<p>PREFACE</p>
<p>Tins volume contains twelve essays written at various
times<br>
during recent years. Many of them are studies contributed to<br>
Scientific Reviews or delivered as popular lectures. Some are<br>
expositions of views the scientific basis of which may be<br>
regarded as established. Others&mdash;the greater
number&mdash;may be<br>
described as attempting the solution of problems which cannot
be<br>
approached by direct observation.</p>
<p>The essay on The Birth-time of the World is based on a
lecture<br>
delivered before the Royal Dublin Society. The subject has<br>
attracted much attention within recent years. The age of the<br>
Earth is, indeed, of primary importance in our conception of
the<br>
longevity of planetary systems. The essay deals with the<br>
evidence, derived from the investigation of purely
terrestrial<br>
phenomena, as to the period which has elapsed since the ocean<br>
condensed upon the Earth's surface. Dr. Decker's recent
addition<br>
to the subject appeared too late for inclusion in it. He
finds<br>
that the movements (termed isostatic) which geologists
recognise<br>
as taking place deep in the Earth's crust, indicate an age of
the<br>
same order of magnitude</p>
<p>xi</p>
<p>as that which is inferred from the statistics of
denudative<br>
history.[1]</p>
<p>The subject of _Denudation_ naturally arises from the first
essay.<br>
In thinking over the method of finding the age of the ocean
by<br>
the accumulation of sodium therein, I perceived so long ago
as<br>
1899, when my first paper was published, that this method<br>
afforded a means of ascertaining the grand total of
denudative<br>
work effected on the Earth's surface since the beginning of<br>
geological time; the resulting knowledge in no way involving
any<br>
assumption as to the duration of the period comprising the<br>
denudative actions. This idea has been elaborated in various<br>
publications since then, both by myself and by others.<br>
"Denudation," while including a survey of the subject
generally,<br>
is mainly a popular account of this method and its results.
It<br>
closes with a reference to the fascinating problems presented
by<br>
the inner nature of sedimentation: a branch of science to which
I<br>
endeavoured to contribute some years ago.</p>
<p>_Mountain Genesis_ first brings in the subject of the
geological<br>
intervention of radioactivity. There can, I believe, be no
doubt<br>
as to the influence of transforming elements upon the<br>
developments of the surface features of the Earth; and, if I
am<br>
right, this source of thermal energy is mainly responsible
for<br>
that local accumulation of wrinkling which we term mountain<br>
chains. The</p>
<p>[1] Bull. Geol. Soc. America, vol. xxvi, March 1915.</p>
<p>xii</p>
<p>paper on _Alpine Structure_ is a reprint from "Radioactivity
and<br>
Geology," which for the sake of completeness is here included.
It<br>
is directed to the elucidation of a detail of mountain genesis:
a<br>
detail which enters into recent theories of Alpine
development.<br>
The weakness of the theory of the "horst" is manifest,
however,<br>
in many of its other applications; if not, indeed, in all.</p>
<p>The foregoing essays on the physical influences affecting
the<br>
surface features of the Earth are accompanied by one entitled
_The<br>
Abundance of Life._ This originated amidst the overwhelming<br>
presentation of life which confronts us in the Swiss Alps.
The<br>
subject is sufficiently inspiring. Can no fundamental reason
be<br>
given for the urgency and aggressiveness of life? Vitality is
an<br>
ever-extending phenomenon. It is plain that the great
principles<br>
which have been enunciated in explanation of the origin of<br>
species do not really touch the problem. In the essay&mdash;which
is an<br>
early one (1890)&mdash;the explanation of the whole great matter
is<br>
sought&mdash;and as I believe found&mdash;in the attitude of the
organism<br>
towards energy external to it; an attitude which results in
its<br>
evasion of the retardative and dissipatory effects which
prevail<br>
in lifeless dynamic systems of all kinds.</p>
<p>_Other Minds than Ours_? attempts a solution of the vexed
question<br>
of the origin of the Martian "canals." The essay is an
abridgment<br>
of two popular lectures on the subject. I had previously
written<br>
an account of my views which carried the enquiry as far as it
was<br>
in</p>
<p>xiii</p>
<p>my power to go. This paper appeared in the "Transactions of
the<br>
Royal Dublin Society, 1897." The theory put forward is a
purely<br>
physical one, and, if justified, the view that intelligent
beings<br>
exist in Mars derives no support from his visible surface<br>
features; but is, in fact, confronted with fresh
difficulties.</p>
<p>_Pleochroic Haloes_ is a popular exposition of an
inconspicuous but<br>
very beautiful phenomenon of the rocks. Minute darkened
spheres&mdash;a<br>
microscopic detail&mdash;appear everywhere in certain of the
rock<br>
minerals. What are they? The discoveries of recent
radioactive<br>
research&mdash;chiefly due to Rutherford&mdash;give the answer.
The<br>
measurements applied to the little objects render the
explanation<br>
beyond question. They turn out to be a quite extraordinary
record<br>
of radioactive energy; a record accumulated since remote<br>
geological times, and assuring us, indirectly, of the
stability<br>
of the chemical elements in general since the beginning of
the<br>
world. This assurance is, without proof, often assumed in our<br>
views on the geological history of the Globe.</p>
<p>Skating is a discourse, with a recent addition supporting
the<br>
original thesis. It is an illustration of a common
experience&mdash;the<br>
explanation of an unimportant action involving principles the<br>
most influential considered as a part of Nature's resources.</p>
<p>The address on _The Latent Image_ deals with a subject which
had<br>
been approached by various writers before the time of my
essay;<br>
but, so far as I know, an explanation</p>
<p>xiv</p>
<p>based on the facts of photo-electricity had not been
attempted.<br>
Students of this subject will notice that the views expressed
are<br>
similar to those subsequently put forward by Lenard and
Saeland<br>
in explanation of phosphorescence. The whole matter is of
more<br>
practical importance than appears at first sight, for the<br>
photoelectric nature of the effects involved in the radiative<br>
treatment of many cruel diseases seems to be beyond doubt.</p>
<p>It was in connection with photo-electric science that I was
led<br>
to take an interest in the application of radioactivity in<br>
medicine. The lecture on _The Use of Radium in Medicine_ deals
with<br>
this subject. Towards the conclusion of this essay reference
will<br>
be found to a practical outcome of such studies which, by<br>
improving on the methods, and facilitating the application,
of<br>
radioactive treatment, has, in the hands of skilled medical
men,<br>
already resulted in the alleviation of suffering.</p>
<p>Leaving out much which might well appear in a prefatory
notice, a<br>
word should yet be added respecting the illustrations of
scenery.<br>
They are a small selection from a considerable number of<br>
photographs taken during my summer wanderings in the Alps in<br>
company with Henry H. Dixon. An exception is Plate X, which is
by<br>
the late Dr. Edward Stapleton. From what has been said above,
it<br>
will be gathered that these illustrations are fitly included<br>
among pages which owe so much to Alpine inspiration. They<br>
illustrate the</p>
<p>xv</p>
<p>subjects dealt with, and, it is to be hoped, they will in
some<br>
cases recall to the reader scenes which have in past times<br>
influenced his thoughts in the same manner; scenes which in
their<br>
endless perspective seem to reduce to their proper
insignificance<br>
the lesser things of life.</p>
<p>My thanks are due to Mr. John Murray for kindly consenting to
the<br>
reissue of the essay on _The Birth-time of the World_ from
the<br>
pages of _Science Progress_; to Messrs. Constable &amp; Co. for
leave<br>
to reprint _Pleochroic Haloes_ from _Bedrock_, and also to make
some<br>
extracts from _Radioactivity and Geology_; and to the Council
of<br>
the Royal Dublin Society for permission to republish certain<br>
papers from the Proceedings of the Society.</p>

<p><u>THE BIRTH-TIME OF THE WORLD</u> [1]</p>
<p>LONG ago Lucretius wrote: "For lack of power to solve the<br>
question troubles the mind with doubts, whether there was ever
a<br>
birth-time of the world and whether likewise there is to be
any<br>
end." "And if" (he says in answer) "there was no birth-time
of<br>
earth and heaven and they have been from everlasting, why
before<br>
the Theban war and the destruction of Troy have not other
poets<br>
as well sung other themes? Whither have so many deeds of men
so<br>
often passed away, why live they nowhere embodied in lasting<br>
records of fame? The truth methinks is that the sum has but a<br>
recent date, and the nature of the world is new and has but<br>
lately had its commencement."[2]</p>
<p>Thus spake Lucretius nearly 2,000 years ago. Since then we
have<br>
attained another standpoint and found very different
limitations.<br>
To Lucretius the world commenced with man, and the answer he<br>
would give to his questions was in accord with his philosophy:
he<br>
would date the birth-time of the world from the time when</p>
<p>[1] A lecture delivered before the Royal Dublin Society,
February<br>
6th, 1914. _Science Progress_, vol. ix., p. 37</p>
<p>[2] _De Rerum Natura_, translated by H. A. J. Munro
(Cambridge,<br>
1886).</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>poets first sang upon the earth. Modern Science has along
with<br>
the theory that the Earth dated its beginning with the advent
of<br>
man, swept utterly away this beautiful imagining. We can,
indeed,<br>
find no beginning of the world. We trace back events and come
to<br>
barriers which close our vista&mdash;barriers which, for all we
know,<br>
may for ever close it. They stand like the gates of ivory and
of<br>
horn; portals from which only dreams proceed; and Science
cannot<br>
as yet say of this or that dream if it proceeds from the gate
of<br>
horn or from that of ivory.</p>
<p>In short, of the Earth's origin we have no certain knowledge;
nor<br>
can we assign any date to it. Possibly its formation was an
event<br>
so gradual that the beginning was spread over immense periods.
We<br>
can only trace the history back to certain events which may
with<br>
considerable certainty be regarded as ushering in our
geological<br>
era.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding our limitations, the date of the birth-time
of<br>
our geological era is the most important date in Science. For
in<br>
taking into our minds the spacious history of the universe,
the<br>
world's age must play the part of time-unit upon which all
our<br>
conceptions depend. If we date the geological history of the<br>
Earth by thousands of years, as did our forerunners, we must<br>
shape our ideas of planetary time accordingly; and the
duration<br>
of our solar system, and of the heavens, becomes comparable
with<br>
that of the dynasties of ancient nations. If by millions of<br>
years, the sun and stars are proportionately venerable. If by<br>
hundreds or thousands of millions of</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>years the human mind must consent to correspondingly vast
epochs<br>
for the duration of material changes. The geological age
plays<br>
the same part in our views of the duration of the universe as
the<br>
Earth's orbital radius does in our views of the immensity of<br>
space. Lucretius knew nothing of our time-unit: his unit was
the<br>
life of a man. So also he knew nothing of our space-unit, and
he<br>
marvels that so small a body as the sun can shed so much,
heat<br>
and light upon the Earth.</p>
<p>A study of the rocks shows us that the world was not always
what<br>
it now is and long has been. We live in an epoch of
denudation.<br>
The rains and frosts disintegrate the hills; and the rivers
roll<br>
to the sea the finely divided particles into which they have
been<br>
resolved; as well as the salts which have been leached from
them.<br>
The sediments collect near the coasts of the continents; the<br>
dissolved matter mingles with the general ocean. The
geologist<br>
has measured and mapped these deposits and traced them back
into<br>
the past, layer by layer. He finds them ever the same;<br>
sandstones, slates, limestones, etc. But one thing is not the<br>
same. _Life_ grows ever less diversified in character as the<br>
sediments are traced downwards. Mammals and birds, reptiles,<br>
amphibians, fishes, die out successively in the past; and
barren<br>
sediments ultimately succeed, leaving the first beginnings of<br>
life undecipherable. Beneath these barren sediments lie rocks<br>
collectively differing in character from those above: mainly<br>
volcanic or poured out from fissures in</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>the early crust of the Earth. Sediments are scarce among
these<br>
materials.[1]</p>
<p>There can be little doubt that in this underlying floor of<br>
igneous and metamorphic rocks we have reached those surface<br>
materials of the earth which existed before the long epoch of<br>
sedimentation began, and before the seas came into being.
They<br>
formed the floor of a vaporised ocean upon which the waters<br>
condensed here and there from the hot and heavy atmosphere.
Such<br>
were the probable conditions which preceded the birth-time of
the<br>
ocean and of our era of life and its evolution.</p>
<p>It is from this epoch we date our geological age. Our next<br>
purpose is to consider how long ago, measured in years, that<br>
birth-time was.</p>
<p>That the geological age of the Earth is very great appears
from<br>
what we have already reviewed. The sediments of the past are
many<br>
miles in collective thickness: yet the feeble silt of the
rivers<br>
built them all from base to summit. They have been uplifted
from<br>
the seas and piled into mountains by movements so slow that<br>
during all the time man has been upon the Earth but little
change<br>
would have been visible. The mountains have again been worn
down<br>
into the ocean by denudation and again younger mountains
built<br>
out of their redeposited materials. The contemplation of such<br>
vast events</p>
<p>[1] For a description of these early rocks, see especially
the<br>
monograph of Van Hise and Leith on the pre-Cambrian Geology
of<br>
North America (Bulletin 360, U.S. Geol. Survey).</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>prepares our minds to accept many scores of millions of years
or<br>
hundreds of millions of years, if such be yielded by our<br>
calculations.</p>
<p>THE AGE AS INFERRED FROM THE THICKNESS OF THE SEDIMENTS</p>
<p>The earliest recognised method of arriving at an estimate of
the<br>
Earth's geological age is based upon the measurement of the<br>
collective sediments of geological periods. The method has<br>
undergone much revision from time to time. Let us briefly
review<br>
it on the latest data.</p>
<p>The method consists in measuring the depths of all the
successive<br>
sedimentary deposits where these are best developed. We go
all<br>
over the explored world, recognising the successive deposits
by<br>
their fossils and by their stratigraphical relations,
measuring<br>
their thickness and selecting as part of the data required
those<br>
beds which we believe to most completely represent each<br>
formation. The total of these measurements would tell us the
age<br>
of the Earth if their tale was indeed complete, and if we
knew<br>
the average rate at which they have been deposited. We soon,<br>
however, find difficulties in arriving at the quantities we<br>
require. Thus it is not easy to measure the real thickness of
a<br>
deposit. It may be folded back upon itself, and so we may
measure<br>
it twice over. We may exaggerate its thickness by measuring
it<br>
not quite straight across the bedding or by unwittingly
including<br>
volcanic materials. On the other hand, there</p>
<p>5</p>
<p>may be deposits which are inaccessible to us; or, again,
an<br>
entire absence of deposits; either because not laid down in
the<br>
areas we examine, or, if laid down, again washed into the
sea.<br>
These sources of error in part neutralise one another. Some
make<br>
our resulting age too long, others make it out too short. But
we<br>
do not know if a balance of error does not still remain.
Here,<br>
however, is a table of deposits which summarises a great deal
of<br>
our knowledge of the thickness of the stratigraphical<br>
accumulations. It is due to Sollas.[1]</p>

<p>In the next place we require to know the average rate at
which<br>
these rocks were laid down. This is really the weakest link
in<br>
the chain. The most diverse results have been arrived at,
which<br>
space does not permit us to consider. The value required is
most<br>
difficult to determine, for it is different for the different<br>
classes of material, and varies from river to river according
to<br>
the conditions of discharge to the sea. We may probably take
it<br>
as between two and six inches in a century.</p>
<p>Now the total depth of the sediments as we see is about
335,000<br>
feet (or 64 miles), and if we take the rate of collecting as<br>
three inches in a hundred years we get the time for all to<br>
collect as 134 millions of years. If the rate be four inches,
the<br>
time is soo millions of years, which is the figure Geikie<br>
favoured, although his result was based on somewhat different<br>
data. Sollas most recently finds 80 millions of years.[1]</p>
<p>THE AGE AS INFERRED FROM THE MASS OF THE SEDIMENTS</p>
<p>In the above method we obtain our result by the measurement
of<br>
the linear dimensions of the sediments. These measurements, as
we<br>
have seen, are difficult to arrive at. We may, however,
proceed<br>
by measurements of the mass of the sediments, and then the
method<br>
becomes more definite. The new method is pursued as follows:</p>
<p>[1] Geikie, _Text Book of Geology_ (Macmillan, 1903), vol. i.,
p.<br>
73, _et seq._ Sollas, _loc. cit._ Joly, _Radioactivity and
Geology_<br>
(Constable, 1909), and Phil. Mag., Sept. 1911.</p>
<p>7</p>
<p>The total mass of the sediments formed since denudation began
may<br>
be ascertained with comparative accuracy by a study of the<br>
chemical composition of the waters of the ocean. The salts in
the<br>
ocean are undoubtedly derived from the rocks; increasing age
by<br>
age as the latter are degraded from their original character<br>
under the action of the weather, etc., and converted to the<br>
sedimentary form. By comparing the average chemical
composition<br>
of these two classes of material&mdash;the primary or igneous
rocks and<br>
the sedimentary&mdash;it is easy to arrive at a knowledge of how
much<br>
of this or that constituent was given to the ocean by each ton
of<br>
primary rock which was denuded to the sedimentary form. This,<br>
however, will not assist us to our object unless the ocean
has<br>
retained the salts shed into it. It has not generally done so.
In<br>
the case of every substance but one the ocean continually
gives<br>
up again more or less of the salts supplied to it by the
rivers.<br>
The one exception is the element sodium. The great solubility
of<br>
its salts has protected it from abstraction, and it has gone
on<br>
collecting during geological time, practically in its
entirety.<br>
This gives us the clue to the denudative history of the<br>
Earth.[1]</p>
<p>The process is now simple. We estimate by chemical examination
of<br>
igneous and sedimentary rocks the amount of sodium which has
been<br>
supplied to the ocean per ton of sediment produced by
denudation.<br>
We also calculate</p>
<p>[1] _Trans. R.D.S._, May, 1899.</p>
<p>8</p>
<p>the amount of sodium contained in the ocean. We divide the
one<br>
into the other (stated, of course, in the same units of
mass),<br>
and the quotient gives us the number of tons of sediment. The<br>
most recent estimate of the sediments made in this manner
affords<br>
56 x 10<sup>16</sup> tonnes.[1]</p>
<p>Now we are assured that all this sediment was transported by
the<br>
rivers to the sea during geological time. Thus it follows
that,<br>
if we can estimate the average annual rate of the river supply
of<br>
sediments to the ocean over the past, we can calculate the<br>
required age. The land surface is at present largely covered
with<br>
the sedimentary rocks themselves. Sediment derived from these<br>
rocks must be regarded as, for the most part, purely
cyclical;<br>
that is, circulating from the sea to the land and back again.
It<br>
does not go to increase the great body of detrital deposits.
We<br>
cannot, therefore, take the present river supply of sediment
as<br>
representing that obtaining over the long past. If the land
was<br>
all covered still with primary rocks we might do so. It has
been<br>
estimated that about 25 per cent. of the existing continental<br>
area is covered with arch&aelig;an and igneous rocks, the
remainder<br>
being sediments.[2] On this estimate we may find valuable</p>
<p>[1] Clarke, _A Preliminary Study of Chemical Denudation_<br>
(Washington, 1910). My own estimate in 1899 (_loc. cit._) made as
a<br>
test of yet another method of finding the age, showed that
the<br>
sediments may be taken as sufficient to form a layer 1.1 mile<br>
deep if spread uniformly over the continents; and would amount
to<br>
64 x 10<sup>18</sup> tons.</p>
<p>[2] Van Tillo, _Comptes Rendues_ (Paris), vol. cxiv.,
1892.</p>
<p>9</p>
<p>major and minor limits to the geological age. If we take 25
per<br>
cent. only of the present river supply of sediment, we
evidently<br>
fix a major limit to the age, for it is certain that over the<br>
past there must have been on the average a faster supply. If
we<br>
take the entire river supply, on similar reasoning we have
what<br>
is undoubtedly a minor limit to the age.</p>
<p>The river supply of detrital sediment has not been very<br>
extensively investigated, although the quantities involved may
be<br>
found with comparative ease and accuracy. The following table<br>
embodies the results obtained for some of the leading
rivers.[1]</p>

<p>We see that the ratio of the weight of water to the</p>
<p>[1] Russell, _River Development_ (John Murray, 1888).</p>
<p>10</p>
<p>weight of transported sediment in six out of the nine rivers
does<br>
not vary widely. The mean is 2,730 to 1. But this is not the<br>
required average. The water-discharge of each river has to be<br>
taken into account. If we ascribe to the ratio given for each<br>
river the weight proper to the amount of water it discharges,
the<br>
proportion of weight of water to weight of sediment, for the<br>
whole quantity of water involved, comes out as 2,520 to 1.</p>
<p>Now if this proportion holds for all the rivers of the<br>
world&mdash;which collectively discharge about 27 x 1012 tonnes
of<br>
water per annum&mdash;the river-born detritus is 1.07 x 1010
tonnes. To<br>
this an addition of 11 per cent. has to be made for silt
pushed<br>
along the river-bed.[1] On these figures the minor limit to
the<br>
age comes out as 47 millions of years, and the major limit as
188<br>
millions. We are here going on rather deficient estimates,
the<br>
rivers involved representing only some 6 per cent. of the
total<br>
river supply of water to the ocean. But the result is
probably<br>
not very far out.</p>
<p>We may arrive at a probable age lying between the major and
minor<br>
limits. If, first, we take the arithmetic mean of these
limits,<br>
we get 117 millions of years. Now this is almost certainly<br>
excessive, for we here assume that the rate of covering of
the<br>
primary rocks by sediments was uniform. It would not be so,<br>
however, for the rate of supply of original sediment must
have<br>
been continually diminishing</p>
<p>[1] According to observations made on the Mississippi
(Russell,<br>
_loc. cit._).</p>
<p>11</p>
<p>during geological time, and hence we may assume that the rate
of<br>
advance of the sediments on the primary rocks has also been<br>
diminishing. Now we may probably take, as a fair assumption,
that<br>
the sediment-covered area was at any instant increasing at a
rate<br>
proportionate to the rate of supply of sediment; that is, to
the<br>
area of primary rocks then exposed. On this assumption the age
is<br>
found to be 87 millions of years.</p>
<p>THE AGE BY THE SODIUM OF THE OCEAN</p>
<p>I have next to lay before you a quite different method. I
have<br>
already touched upon the chemistry of the ocean, and on the<br>
remarkable fact that the sodium contained in it has been<br>
preserved, practically, in its entirety from the beginning of<br>
geological time.</p>
<p>That the sea is one of the most beautiful and magnificent
sights<br>
in Nature, all admit. But, I think, to those who know its
story<br>
its beauty and magnificence are ten-fold increased. Its
saltness<br>
it due to no magic mill. It is the dissolved rocks of the
Earth<br>
which give it at once its brine, its strength, and its
buoyancy.<br>
The rivers which we say flow with "fresh" water to the sea<br>
nevertheless contain those traces of salt which, collected
over<br>
the long ages, occasion the saltness of the ocean. Each gallon
of<br>
river water contributes to the final result; and this has
been<br>
going on since the beginning of our era. The mighty total of
the<br>
rivers is 6,500 cubic miles of water in the year!</p>
<p>12</p>
<p>There is little doubt that the primeval ocean was in the<br>
condition of a fresh-water lake. It can be shown that a
primitive<br>
and more rapid solution of the original crust of the Earth by
the<br>
slowly cooling ocean would have given rise to relatively
small<br>
salinity. The fact is, the quantity of salts in the ocean is<br>
enormous. We are only now concerned with the sodium; but if
we<br>
could extract all the rock-salt (the chloride of sodium) from
the<br>
ocean we should have enough to cover the entire dry land of
the<br>
Earth to a depth of 400 feet. It is this gigantic quantity
which<br>
is going to enter into our estimate of the Earth's age. The<br>
calculated mass of sodium contained in this rock-salt is
14,130<br>
million million tonnes.</p>
<p>If now we can determine the rate at which the rivers
supply<br>
sodium to the ocean, we can determine the age.[1] As the
result<br>
of many thousands of river analyses, the total amount of
sodium<br>
annually discharged to the ocean</p>
<p>[1] _Trans. R.D.S._, 1899. A paper by Edmund Halley, the<br>
astronomer, in the _Philosophical Transactions of the Royal<br>
Society_ for 1715, contains a suggestion for finding the age
of<br>
the world by the following procedure. He proposes to make<br>
observations on the saltness of the seas and ocean at
intervals<br>
of one or more centuries, and from the increment of saltness<br>
arrive at their age. The measurements, as a matter of fact,
are<br>
impracticable. The salinity would only gain (if all remained
in<br>
solution) one millionth part in Too years; and, of course,
the<br>
continuous rejection of salts by the ocean would invalidate
the<br>
method. The last objection also invalidates the calculation by
T.<br>
Mellard Reade (_Proc. Liverpool Geol. Soc._, 1876) of a minor
limit<br>
to the age by the calcium sulphate in the ocean. Both papers
were<br>
quite unknown to me when working out my method. Halley's
paper<br>
was, I think, only brought to light in 1908.</p>
<p>13</p>
<p>by all the rivers of the world is found to be probably not
far<br>
from 175 million tonnes.[1] Dividing this into the mass of<br>
oceanic sodium we get the age as 80.7 millions of years.
Certain<br>
corrections have to be applied to this figure which result in<br>
raising it to a little over 90 millions of years. Sollas, as
the<br>
result of a careful review of the data, gets the age as
between<br>
80 and 150 millions of years. My own result[2] was between 80
and<br>
90 millions of years; but I subsequently found that upon
certain<br>
extreme assumptions a maximum age might be arrived at of 105<br>
millions of years.[3] Clarke regards the 80.7 millions of
years<br>
as certainly a maximum in the light of certain calculations
by<br>
Becker.[4]</p>
<p>The order of magnitude of these results cannot be shaken
unless<br>
on the assumption that there is something entirely misleading
in<br>
the existing rate of solvent denudation. On the strength of
the<br>
results of another and</p>
<p>[1] F. W. Clarke, _A Preliminary Study of Chemical
Denudation_<br>
(Smithsonian Miscellaneous Collections, 1910).</p>
<p>[2] _Loc. cit._</p>
<p>[3] "The Circulation of Salt and Geological Time" (Geol.
Mag.,<br>
1901, p. 350).</p>
<p>[4] Becker (loc. cit.), assuming that the exposed igneous
and<br>
arch&aelig;an rocks alone are responsible for the supply of
sodium to<br>
the ocean, arrives at 74 millions of years as the geological
age.<br>
This matter was discussed by me formerly (Trans. R.D.S.,
1899,<br>
pp. 54 _et seq._). The assumption made is, I believe,
inadmissible.<br>
It is not supported by river analyses, or by the chemical<br>
character of residual soils from sedimentary rocks. There may
be<br>
some convergence in the rate of solvent denudation, but&mdash;as
I<br>
think on the evidence&mdash;in our time unimportant.</p>
<p>14</p>
<p>entirely different method of approaching the question of
the<br>
Earth's age (which shall be presently referred to), it has
been<br>
contended that it is too low. It is even asserted that it is
from<br>
nine to fourteen times too low. We have then to consider
whether<br>
such an enormous error can enter into the method. The<br>
measurements involved cannot be seriously impugned.
Corrections<br>
for possible errors applied to the quantities entering into
this<br>
method have been considered by various writers. My own
original<br>
corrections have been generally confirmed. I think the only
point<br>
left open for discussion is the principle of
uniformitarianism<br>
involved in this method and in the methods previously
discussed.</p>
<p>In order to appreciate the force of the evidence for
uniformity<br>
in the geological history of the Earth, it is, of course,<br>
necessary to possess some acquaintance with geological
science.<br>
Some of the most eminent geologists, among whom Lyell and<br>
Geikie[1] may be mentioned, have upheld the doctrine of<br>
uniformity. It must here suffice to dwell upon a few points<br>
having special reference to the matter under discussion.</p>
<p>The mere extent of the land surface does not, within
limits,<br>
affect the question of the rate of denudation. This arises
from<br>
the fact that the rain supply is quite insufficient to denude
the<br>
whole existing land surface. About 30 per cent. of it does
not,<br>
in fact, drain to the</p>
<p>[1] See especially Geikie's Address to Sect. C., Brit.
Assoc.<br>
Rep., 1399.</p>
<p>15</p>
<p>ocean. If the continents become invaded by a great
transgression<br>
of the ocean, this "rainless" area diminishes: and the
denuded<br>
area advances inwards without diminution. If the ocean
recedes<br>
from the present strand lines, the "rainless" area advances<br>
outwards, but, the rain supply being sensibly constant, no
change<br>
in the river supply of salts is to be expected.</p>
<p>Age-long submergence of the entire land, or of any very
large<br>
proportion of what now exists, is negatived by the continuous<br>
sequence of vast areas of sediment in every geologic age from
the<br>
earliest times. Now sediment-receiving areas always are but a<br>
small fraction of those exposed areas whence the sediments
are<br>
supplied.[1] Hence in the continuous records of the sediments
we<br>
have assurance of the continuous exposure of the continents
above<br>
the ocean surface. The doctrine of the permanency of the<br>
continents has in its main features been accepted by the most<br>
eminent authorities. As to the actual amount of land which
was<br>
exposed during past times to denudative effects, no data exist
to<br>
show it was very different from what is now exposed. It has
been<br>
estimated that the average area of the North American
continent<br>
over geologic time was about eight-tenths of its existing<br>
area.[2] Restorations of other continents, so far as they
have<br>
been attempted, would not</p>
<p>[1] On the strength of the Mississippi measurements about 1 to
18<br>
(Magee, _Am. Jour. of Sc._, 1892, p. 188).</p>
<p>[2] Schuchert, _Bull. Geol. Soc. Am._, vol. xx., 1910.</p>
<p>16</p>
<p>suggest any more serious divergency one way or the other.</p>
<p>That climate in the oceans and upon the land was throughout
much<br>
as it is now, the continuous chain of teeming life and the<br>
sensitive temperature limits of protoplasmic existence are<br>
sufficient evidence.[1] The influence at once of climate and
of<br>
elevation of the land may be appraised at their true value by
the<br>
ascertained facts of solvent denudation, as the following
table<br>
shows.</p>

Asia -                   84                  950<br>
Africa -                 44                  650</p>
<p>In this table the estimated number of tonnes of matter in<br>
solution, which for every square mile of area the rivers
convey<br>
to the ocean in one year, is given in the first column. These<br>
results are compiled by Clarke from a very large number of<br>
analyses of river waters. The second column of the table
gives<br>
the mean heights in metres above sea level of the several<br>
continents, as cited by Arrhenius.[2]</p>
<p>Of all the denudation results given in the table, those
relating<br>
to North America and to Europe are far the</p>
<p>[1] See also Poulton, Address to Sect. D., Brit. Assoc.
Rep.,<br>
1896.</p>
<p>[2] _Lehybuch dev Kosmischen Physik_, vol. i., p. 347.</p>
<p>17</p>
<p>most reliable. Indeed these may be described as highly
reliable,<br>
being founded on some thousands of analyses, many of which
have<br>
been systematically pursued through every season of the year.<br>
These show that Europe with a mean altitude of less than half<br>
that of North America sheds to the ocean 25 per cent. more
salts.<br>
A result which is to be expected when the more important
factors<br>
of solvent denudation are given intelligent consideration and
we<br>
discriminate between conditions favouring solvent and
detrital<br>
denudation respectively: conditions in many cases<br>
antagonistic.[1] Hence if it is true, as has been stated, that
we<br>
now live in a period of exceptionally high continental
elevation,<br>
we must infer that the average supply of salts to the ocean
by<br>
the rivers of the world is less than over the long past, and<br>
that, therefore, our estimate of the age of the Earth as
already<br>
given is excessive.</p>
<p>There is, however, one condition which will operate to
unduly<br>
diminish our estimate of geologic time, and it is a condition<br>
which may possibly obtain at the present time. If the land is,
on<br>
the whole, now sinking relatively to the ocean level, the<br>
denudation area tends, as we have seen, to move inwards. It
will<br>
thus encroach upon regions which have not for long periods<br>
drained to the ocean. On such areas there is an accumulation
of<br>
soluble salts which the deficient rivers have not been able
to<br>
carry to the ocean. Thus the salt content of certain of</p>
<p>[1] See the essay on Denudation.</p>
<p>18</p>
<p>the rivers draining to the ocean will be influenced not only
by<br>
present denudative effects, but also by the stored results of<br>
past effects. Certain rivers appear to reveal this unduly<br>
increased salt supply those which flow through comparatively
arid<br>
areas. However, the flowoff of such tributaries is relatively<br>
small and the final effects on the great rivers apparently<br>
unimportant&mdash;a result which might have been anticipated when
the<br>
extremely slow rate of the land movements is taken into
account.</p>
<p>The difficulty of effecting any reconciliation of the
methods<br>
already described and that now to be given increases the
interest<br>
both of the former and the latter.</p>
<p>THE AGE BY RADIOACTIVE TRANSFORMATIONS</p>
<p>Rutherford suggested in 1905 that as helium was continually
being<br>
evolved at a uniform rate by radioactive substances (in the
form<br>
of the alpha rays) a determination of the age of minerals<br>
containing the radioactive elements might be made by
measurements<br>
of the amount of the stored helium and of the radioactive<br>
elements giving rise to it, The parent radioactive substances<br>
are&mdash;according to present knowledge&mdash;uranium and
thorium. An<br>
estimate of the amounts of these elements present enables the<br>
rate of production of the helium to be calculated. Rutherford<br>
shortly afterwards found by this method an age of 240 millions
of<br>
years for a radioactive mineral of presumably remote age.
Strutt,<br>
who carried</p>
<p>19</p>
<p>his measurements to a wonderful degree of refinement, found
the<br>
following ages for mineral substances originating in
different<br>
geological ages:</p>
<p>Oligocene -               8.4 millions of years.<br>
Eocene -                 31    millions of years.<br>
Lower Carboniferous -  150   millions of years.<br>
Arch&aelig;an -               750    millions of years.</p>
<p>Periods of time much less than, and very inconsistent with,
these<br>
were also found. The lower results are, however, easily
explained<br>
if we assume that the helium&mdash;which is a gas under
prevailing<br>
conditions&mdash;escapes in many cases slowly from the
mineral.</p>
<p>Another product of radioactive origin is lead. The
suggestion<br>
that this substance might be made available to determine the
age<br>
of the Earth also originated with Rutherford. We are at least<br>
assured that this element cannot escape by gaseous diffusion
from<br>
the minerals. Boltwood's results on the amount of lead
contained<br>
in minerals of various ages, taken in conjunction with the
amount<br>
of uranium or parent substance present, afforded ages rising
to<br>
1,640 millions of years for arch&aelig;an and 1,200 millions
for<br>
Algonkian time. Becker, applying the same method, obtained<br>
results rising to quite incredible periods: from 1,671 to
11,470<br>
millions of years. Becker maintained that original lead
rendered<br>
the determinations indefinite. The more recent results of Mr.
A.<br>
Holmes support the conclusion that "original" lead may be
present<br>
and may completely falsify results derived</p>
<p>20</p>
<p>from minerals of low radioactivity in which the derived
lead<br>
would be small in amount. By rejecting such results as
appeared<br>
to be of this character, he arrives at 370 millions of years
as<br>
the age of the Devonian.</p>
<p>I must now describe a very recent method of estimating the age
of<br>
the Earth. There are, in certain rock-forming minerals,<br>
colour-changes set up by radioactive causes. The minute and<br>
curious marks so produced are known as haloes; for they
surround,<br>
in ringlike forms, minute particles of included substances
which<br>
contain radioactive elements. It is now well known how these<br>
haloes are formed. The particle in the centre of the halo<br>
contains uranium or thorium, and, necessarily, along with the<br>
parent substance, the various elements derived from it. In
the<br>
process of transformation giving rise to these several
derived<br>
substances, atoms of helium&mdash;the alpha rays&mdash;projected
with great<br>
velocity into the surrounding mineral, occasion the colour<br>
changes referred to. These changes are limited to the distance
to<br>
which the alpha rays penetrate; hence the halo is a spherical<br>
volume surrounding the central substance.[1]</p>
<p>The time required to form a halo could be found if on the
one<br>
hand we could ascertain the number of alpha rays ejected from
the<br>
nucleus of the halo in, say, one year, and, on the other, if
we<br>
determined by experiment just how many alpha rays were
required<br>
to produce the same</p>
<p>[1] _Phil. Mag._, March, 1907 and February, 1910; also
_Bedrock_,<br>
January, 1913. See _Pleochroic Haloes_ in this volume.</p>
<p>21</p>
<p>amount of colour alteration as we perceive to extend around
the<br>
nucleus.</p>
<p>The latter estimate is fairly easily and surely made. But to
know<br>
the number of rays leaving the central particle in unit time
we<br>
require to know the quantity of radioactive material in the<br>
nucleus. This cannot be directly determined. We can only,
from<br>
known results obtained with larger specimens of just such a<br>
mineral substance as composes the nucleus, guess at the amount
of<br>
uranium, or it may be thorium, which may be present.</p>
<p>This method has been applied to the uranium haloes of the mica
of<br>
County Carlow.[1] Results for the age of the halo of from 20
to<br>
400 millions of years have been obtained. This mica was
probably<br>
formed in the granite of Leinster in late Silurian or in
Devonian<br>
times.</p>
<p>The higher results are probably the least in error, upon the
data<br>
involved; for the assumption made as to the amount of uranium
in<br>
the nuclei of the haloes was such as to render the higher
results<br>
the more reliable.</p>
<p>This method is, of course, a radioactive method, and similar
to<br>
the method by helium storage, save that it is free of the risk
of<br>
error by escape of the helium, the effects of which are, as
it<br>
were, registered at the moment of its production, so that its<br>
subsequent escape is of no moment.</p>

<p>22</p>
<p>REVIEW OF THE RESULTS</p>
<p>We shall now briefly review the results on the geological age
of<br>
the Earth.</p>
<p>By methods based on the approximate uniformity of
denudative<br>
effects in the past, a period of the order of 100 millions of<br>
years has been obtained as the duration of our geological
age;<br>
and consistently whether we accept for measurement the
sediments<br>
or the dissolved sodium. We can give reasons why these<br>
measurements might afford too great an age, but we can find<br>
absolutely no good reason why they should give one much too
low.</p>
<p>By measuring radioactive products ages have been found
which,<br>
while they vary widely among themselves, yet claim to possess<br>
accuracy in their superior limits, and exceed those derived
from<br>
denudation from nine to fourteen times.</p>
<p>In this difficulty let us consider the claims of the
radioactive<br>
method in any of its forms. In order to be trustworthy it must
be<br>
true; (1) that the rate of transformation now shown by the
parent<br>
substance has obtained throughout the entire past, and (2)
that<br>
there were no other radioactive substances, either now or<br>
formerly existing, except uranium, which gave rise to lead.
As<br>
regards methods based on the production of helium, what we
have<br>
to say will largely apply to it also. If some unknown source
of<br>
these elements exists we, of course, on our assumption<br>
overestimate the age.</p>
<p>23</p>
<p>As regards the first point: In ascribing a constant rate
of<br>
change to the parent substance&mdash;which Becker (loc. cit.)
describes<br>
as "a simple though tremendous extrapolation"&mdash;we reason
upon<br>
analogy with the constant rate of decay observed in the
derived<br>
radioactive bodies. If uranium and thorium are really primary<br>
elements, however, the analogy relied on may be misleading;
at<br>
least, it is obviously incomplete. It is incomplete in a<br>
particular which may be very important: the mode of origin of<br>
these parent bodies&mdash;whatever it may have been&mdash;is
different to<br>
that of the secondary elements with which we compare them. A<br>
convergence in their rate of transformation is not impossible,
or<br>
even improbable, so far as we known.</p>
<p>As regards the second point: It is assumed that uranium alone
of<br>
the elements in radioactive minerals is ultimately transformed
to<br>
lead by radioactive changes. We must consider this
assumption.</p>
<p>Recent advances in the chemistry of the radioactive elements
has<br>
brought out evidence that all three lines of radioactive
descent<br>
known to us&mdash;_i.e._ those beginning with uranium, with
thorium,<br>
and with actinium&mdash;alike converge to lead.[1] There are<br>
difficulties in the way of believing that all the lead-like
atoms<br>
so produced ("isotopes" of lead, as Soddy proposes to call
them)<br>
actually remain as stable lead in the minerals. For one</p>
<p>[1] See Soddy's _Chemistry of the Radioactive Elements_
(Longmans,<br>
Green &amp; Co.).</p>
<p>24</p>
<p>thing there is sometimes, along with very large amounts of<br>
thorium, an almost entire absence of lead in thorianites and<br>
thorites. And in some urano&mdash;thorites the lead may be
noticed to<br>
follow the uranium in approximate proportionality,<br>
notwithstanding the presence of large amounts of thorium.[1]
This<br>
is in favour of the assumption that all the lead present is<br>
derived from the uranium. The actinium is present in
negligibly<br>
small amounts.</p>
<p>On the other hand, there is evidence arising from the
atomic<br>
weight of lead which seems to involve some other parent than<br>
uranium. Soddy, in the work referred to, points this out. The<br>
atomic weight of radium is well known, and uranium in its
descent<br>
has to change to this element. The loss of mass between
radium<br>
and uranium-derived lead can be accurately estimated by the<br>
number of alpha rays given off. From this we get the atomic<br>
weight of uranium-derived lead as closely 206. Now the best<br>
determinations of the atomic weight of normal lead assign to
this<br>
element an atomic weight of closely</p>
<p>[1] It seems very difficult at present to suggest an end
product<br>
for thorium, unless we assume that, by loss of electrons,
thorium<br>
E, or thorium-lead, reverts to a substance chemically
identical<br>
with thorium itself. Such a change&mdash;whether considered from
the<br>
point of view of the periodic law or of the radioactive
theory<br>
would involve many interesting consequences. It is, of
course,<br>
quite possible that the nature of the conditions attending
the<br>
deposition of the uranium ores, many of which are
comparatively<br>
recent, are responsible for the difficulties observed. The<br>
thorium and uranium ores are, again, specially prone to<br>
alteration.</p>
<p>25</p>
<p>207. By a somewhat similar calculation it is deduced that<br>
thorium-derived lead would possess the atomic weight of 208.
Thus<br>
normal lead might be an admixture of uranium- and
thorium-derived<br>
lead. However, as we have seen, the view that thorium gives
rise<br>
to stable lead is beset with some difficulties.</p>
<p>If we are going upon reliable facts and figures, we must,
then,<br>
assume: (a) That some other element than uranium, and
genetically<br>
connected with it (probably as parent substance), gives rise,
or<br>
formerly gave rise, to lead of heavier atomic weight than
normal<br>
lead. It may be observed respecting this theory that there is<br>
some support for the view that a parent substance both to
uranium<br>
and thorium has existed or possibly exists. The evidence is
found<br>
in the proportionality frequently observed between the amounts
of<br>
thorium and uranium in the primary rocks.[1] Or: (b) We may
meet<br>
the difficulties in a simpler way, which may be stated as<br>
follows: If we assume that all stable lead is derived from<br>
uranium, and at the same time recognise that lead is not<br>
perfectly homogeneous in atomic weight, we must, of
necessity,<br>
ascribe to uranium a similar want of homogeneity; heavy atoms
of<br>
uranium giving rise to heavy</p>
<p>[1] Compare results for the thorium content of such rocks<br>
(appearing in a paper by the author Cong. Int. _de Radiologie
et<br>
d'Electricit&eacute;_, vol. i., 1910, p. 373), and those for the
radium<br>
content, as collected in _Phil. Mag._, October, 1912, p. 697.<br>
Also A. L. Fletcher, _Phil. Mag._, July, 1910; January, 1911,
and<br>
June, 1911. J. H. J. Poole, _Phil. Mag._, April, 1915</p>
<p>26</p>
<p>atoms of lead and light atoms of uranium generating light
atoms<br>
of lead. This assumption seems to be involved in the figures<br>
upon, which we are going. Still relying on these figures, we<br>
find, however, that existing uranium cannot give rise to lead
of<br>
normal atomic weight. We can only conclude that the heavier
atoms<br>
of uranium have decayed more rapidly than the lighter ones.
In<br>
this connection it is of interest to note the complexity of<br>
uranium as recently established by Geiger, although in this
case<br>
it is assumed that the shorter-lived isotope bears the
relation<br>
of offspring to the longer-lived and largely preponderating<br>
constituent. However, there does not seem to be any direct
proof<br>
of this as yet.</p>
<p>From these considerations it would seem that unless the
atomic<br>
weight of lead in uraninites, etc., is 206, the former
complexity<br>
and more accelerated decay of uranium are indicated in the
data<br>
respecting the atomic weights of radium and lead[1]. As an<br>
alternative view, we may assume, as in our first hypothesis,
that<br>
some elementally different but genetically connected
substance,<br>
decaying along branching lines of descent at a rate sufficient
to<br>
practically remove the whole of it during geological time,<br>
formerly existed. Whichever hypothesis we adopt</p>
<p>[1] Later investigation has shown that the atomic weight of
lead<br>
in uranium-bearing ores is about 206.6 (see Richards and
Lembert,<br>
_Journ. of Am. Claem. Soc._, July, 1914). This result gives
support<br>
to the view expressed above.</p>
<p>27</p>
<p>we are confronted by probabilities which invalidate<br>
time-measurements based on the lead and helium ratio in
minerals.<br>
We have, in short, grave reason to question the measure of<br>
uniformitarianism postulated in finding the age by any of the<br>
known radioactive methods.</p>
<p>That we have much to learn respecting our assumptions, whether
we<br>
pursue the geological or the radioactive methods of
approaching<br>
the age of our era, is, indeed, probable. Whatever the issue
it<br>
is certain that the reconciling facts will leave us with much<br>
more light than we at present possess either as respects the<br>
Earth's history or the history of the radioactive elements.
With<br>
this necessary admission we leave our study of the Birth-Time
of<br>
the World.</p>
<p>It has led us a long way from Lucretius. We do not ask if
other<br>
Iliads have perished; or if poets before Homer have vainly
sung,<br>
becoming a prey to all-consuming time. We move in a greater<br>
history, the landmarks of which are not the birth and death
of<br>
kings and poets, but of species, genera, orders. And we set
out<br>
these organic events not according to the passing generations
of<br>
man, but over scores or hundreds of millions of years.</p>
<p>How much Lucretius has lost, and how much we have gained,
is<br>
bound up with the question of the intrinsic value of
knowledge<br>
and great ideas. Let us appraise knowledge as we would the<br>
Homeric poems, as some-</p>
<p>28</p>
<p>thing which ennobles life and makes it happier. Well, then,
we<br>
are, as I think, in possession today of some of those lost
Iliads<br>
and Odysseys for which Lucretius looked in vain.[1]</p>
<p>[1] The duration in the past of Solar heat is necessarily
bound<br>
up with the geological age. There is no known means (outside<br>
speculative science) of accounting for more than about 30
million<br>
years of the existing solar temperature in the past. In this<br>
direction the age seems certainly limited to 100 million
years.<br>

5th, 1915.</p>
<p>29</p>
<p><u>DENUDATION</u></p>
<p>THE subject of denudation is at once one of the most
interesting<br>
and one of the most complicated with which the geologist has
to<br>
deal. While its great results are apparent even to the most<br>
casual observer, the factors which have led to these results
are<br>
in many cases so indeterminate, and in some cases apparently
so<br>
variable in influence, that thoughtful writers have even
claimed<br>
precisely opposite effects as originating from, the same
cause.<br>
Indeed, it is almost impossible to deal with the subject
without<br>
entering upon controversial matters. In the following pages I<br>
shall endeavour to keep to broad issues which are, at the
present<br>
day, either conceded by the greater number of authorities on
the<br>
subject, or are, from their strictly quantitative character,
not<br>
open to controversy.</p>
<p>It is evident, in the first place, that denudation&mdash;or
the wearing<br>
away of the land surfaces of the earth&mdash;is mainly a result
of the<br>
circulation of water from the ocean to the land, and back
again<br>
to the ocean. An action entirely conditioned by solar heat,
and<br>
without which it would completely cease and further change
upon<br>
the land come to an end.</p>
<p>To what actions, then, is so great a potency of the</p>
<p>30</p>
<p>circulating water to be traced? Broadly speaking, we may
classify<br>
them as mechanical and chemical. The first involves the<br>
separation of rock masses into smaller fragments of all
sizes,<br>
down to the finest dust. The second involves the actual
solution<br>
in the water of the rock constituents, which may be regarded
as<br>
the final act of disintegration. The rivers bear the burden
both<br>
of the comminuted and the dissolved materials to the sea. The
mud<br>
and sand carried by their currents, or gradually pushed along<br>
their beds, represent the former; the invisible dissolved
matter,<br>
only to be demonstrated to the eye by evaporation of the water
or<br>
by chemical precipitation, represents the latter.</p>
<p>The results of these actions, integrated over geological
time,<br>
are enormous. The entire bulk of the sedimentary rocks, such
as<br>
sandstones, slates, shales, conglomerates, limestones, etc.,
and<br>
the salt content of the ocean, are due to the combined
activity<br>
of mechanical and solvent denudation. We shall, later on, make
an<br>
estimate of the magnitude of the quantities actually
involved.</p>
<p>In the Swiss valleys we see torrents of muddy water
hurrying<br>
along, and if we follow them up, we trace them to glaciers
high<br>
among the mountains. From beneath the foot of the glacier, we<br>
find, the torrent has birth. The first debris given to the
river<br>
is derived from the wearing of the rocky bed along which the<br>
glacier moves. The river of ice bequeaths to the river of<br>
water&mdash;of which it is the parent&mdash;the spoils which it
has won from<br>
the rocks</p>
<p>31</p>
<p>The work of mechanical disintegration is, however, not
restricted<br>
to the glacier's bed. It proceeds everywhere over the surface
of<br>
the rocks. It is aided by the most diverse actions. For
instance,<br>
the freezing and expansion of water in the chinks and cracks
in<br>
those alpine heights where between sunrise and sunset the heat
of<br>
summer reigns, and between sunset and sunrise the cold of
winter.<br>
Again, under these conditions the mere change of surface<br>
temperature from night to day severely stresses the surface<br>
layers of the rocks, and, on the same principles as we
explain<br>
the fracture of an unequally heated glass vessel, the rocks<br>
cleave off in slabs which slip down the steeps of the
mountain<br>
and collect as screes in the valley. At lower levels the<br>
expansive force of vegetable growth is not unimportant, as
all<br>
will admit who have seen the strong roots of the pines<br>
penetrating the crannies of the rocks. Nor does the river
which<br>
flows in the bed of the valley act as a carrier only.
Listening<br>
carefully we may detect beneath the roar of the alpine
torrent<br>
the crunching and knocking of descending boulders. And in the<br>
potholes scooped by its whirling waters we recognise the
abrasive<br>
action of the suspended sand upon the river bed.</p>
<p>A view from an Alpine summit reveals a scene of remarkable<br>
desolation (Pl. V, p. 40). Screes lie piled against the steep<br>
slopes. Cliffs stand shattered and ready to fall in ruins.
And<br>
here the forces at work readily reveal themselves. An
occasional<br>
wreath of white smoke among</p>
<p>32</p>
<p>the far-off peaks, followed by a rumbling reverberation,
marks<br>
the fall of an avalanche. Water everywhere trickles through
the<br>
shaly _d&eacute;bris_ scattered around. In the full sunshine the
rocks are<br>
almost too hot to bear touching. A few hours later the cold
is<br>
deadly, and all becomes a frozen silence. In such scenes of<br>
desolation and destruction, detrital sediments are actively
being<br>
generated. As we descend into the valley we hear the deep
voice<br>
of the torrents which are continually hurrying the
disintegrated<br>
rocks to the ocean.</p>
<p>A remarkable demonstration of the activity of mechanical<br>
denudation is shown by the phenomenon of "earth pillars." The<br>
photograph (Pl. IV.) of the earth pillars of the Val
d'H&eacute;rens<br>
(Switzerland) shows the peculiar appearance these objects<br>
present. They arise under conditions where large stones or<br>
boulders are scattered in a deep deposit of clay, and where
much<br>
of the denudation is due to water scour. The large boulders
not<br>
only act as shelter against rain, but they bind and
consolidate<br>
by their mere weight the clay upon which they rest. Hence the<br>
materials underlying the boulders become more resistant, and
as<br>
the surrounding clays are gradually washed away and carried
to<br>
the streams, these compacted parts persist, and, finally,
stand<br>
like walls or pillars above the general level. After a time
the<br>
great boulders fall off and the underlying clay becomes worn
by<br>
the rainwash to fantastic spikes and ridges. In the Val
d'H&eacute;rens<br>
the earth pillars are formed</p>
<p>33</p>
<p>of the deep moraine stuff which thickly overlies the slopes
of<br>
the valley. The wall of pillars runs across the axis of the<br>
valley, down the slope of the hill, and crosses the road, so
that<br>
it has to be tunnelled to permit the passage of traffic. It
is<br>
not improbable that some additional influence&mdash;possibly
the<br>
presence of lime&mdash;has hardened the material forming the
pillars,<br>
and tended to their preservation.</p>
<p>Denudation has, however, other methods of work than purely<br>
mechanical; methods more noiseless and gentle, but not less<br>
effective, as the victories of peace ate no less than those
of<br>
war.</p>
<p>Over the immense tracts of the continents chemical work
proceeds<br>
relentlessly. The rock in general, more especially the
primary<br>
igneous rock, is not stable in presence of the atmosphere and
of<br>
water. Some of the minerals, such as certain silicates and<br>
carbonates, dissolve relatively fast, others with extreme<br>
slowness. In the process of solution chemical actions are<br>
involved; oxidation in presence of the free oxygen of the<br>
atmosphere; attack by the feeble acid arising from the
solution<br>
of carbon dioxide in water; or, again, by the activity of
certain<br>
acids&mdash;humous acids&mdash;which originate in the
decomposition of<br>
vegetable remains. These chemical agents may in some
instances,<br>
_e.g._ in the case of carbonates such as limestone or<br>
dolomite&mdash;bring practically the whole rock into solution. In
other<br>
instances&mdash;_e.g._ granites, basalts, etc.&mdash;they may
remove some of<br>
the</p>
<p>34</p>
<p>constituent minerals completely or partially, such as
felspar,<br>
olivine, augite, and leave more resistant substances to be<br>
ultimately washed down as fine sand or mud into the river.</p>
<p>It is often difficult or impossible to appraise the
relative<br>
efficiency of mechanical and chemical denudation in removing
the<br>
materials from a certain area. There can be, indeed, little
doubt<br>
that in mountainous regions the mechanical effects are
largely<br>
predominant. The silts of glacial rivers are little different<br>
from freshly-powdered rock. The water which carries them but<br>
little different from the pure rain or snow which falls from
the<br>
sky. There has not been time for the chemical or solvent
actions<br>
to take place. Now while gravitational forces favour sudden
shock<br>
and violent motions in the hills, the effect of these on
solvent<br>
and chemical denudation is but small. Nor is good drainage<br>
favourable to chemical actions, for water is the primary
factor<br>
in every case. Water takes up and removes soluble combinations
of<br>
molecules, and penetrates beneath residual insoluble
substances.<br>
It carries the oxygen and acids downwards through the soils,
and<br>
finally conveys the results of its own work to the rivers and<br>
streams. The lower mean temperature of the mountains as well
as<br>
the perfect drainage diminishes chemical activities.</p>
<p>Hence we conclude that the heights are not generally
favourable<br>
to the purely solvent and chemical actions. It is on the<br>
lower-lying land that soils tend to accumulate,</p>
<p>35</p>
<p>and in these the chief solvent and the chief chemical
denudation<br>
of the Earth are effected.</p>
<p>The solvent and chemical effects which go on in the<br>
finely-divided materials of the soils may be observed in the<br>
laboratory. They proceed faster than would be anticipated.
The<br>
observation is made by passing a measured quantity of water<br>
backwards and forwards for some months through a tube
containing<br>
a few grammes of powdered rock. Finally the water is
analysed,<br>
and in this manner the amount of dissolved matter it has taken
up<br>
is estimated. The rock powder is examined under the microscope
in<br>
order to determine the size of the grains, and so to
calculate<br>
the total surface exposed to the action of the water. We must
be<br>
careful in such experiments to permit free oxidation by the<br>
atmosphere. Results obtained in this way of course take no<br>
account of the chemical effects of organic acids such as exist
in<br>
the soils. The quantities obtained in the laboratory will,<br>
therefore, be deficient as compared with the natural results.</p>
<p>In this manner it has been found that fresh basalt exposed
to<br>
continually moving water will lose about 0.20 gramme per
square<br>
metre of surface per year. The mineral orthoclase, which
enters<br>
largely into the constitution of many granites, was found to
lose<br>
under the same conditions 0.025 gramme. A glassy lava
(obsidian)<br>
rich in silica and in the chemical constituents of an average<br>
granite, was more resistant still; losing but 0.013 gramme
per<br>
square metre per year. Hornblende, a mineral</p>
<p>36</p>
<p>abundant in many rocks, lost 0.075 gramme. The mean of the<br>
results showed that 0.08 gramme was washed in a year from
each<br>
square metre. Such results give us some indication of the rate
at<br>
which the work of solution goes on in the finely divided<br>
soils.[1]</p>
<p>It might be urged that, as the mechanical break up of rocks,
and<br>
the production in this way of large surfaces, must be at the<br>
basis of solvent and chemical denudation, these latter
activities<br>
should be predominant in the mountains. The answer to this is<br>
that the soils rarely owe their existence to mechanical
actions.<br>
The alluvium of the valleys constitutes only narrow margins
to<br>
the rivers; the finer _d&eacute;bris_ from the mountains is
rapidly<br>
brought into the ocean. The soils which cover the greater part
of<br>
continental areas have had a very different origin.</p>
<p>In any quarry where a section of the soil and of the
underlying<br>
rock is visible, we may study the mode of formation of soils.
Our<br>
observations are, we will suppose, pursued in a granite
quarry.<br>
We first note that the material of the soil nearest the
surface<br>
is intermixed with the roots of grasses, trees, or shrubs.<br>
Examining a handful of this soil, we see glistening flakes of<br>
mica which plainly are derived from the original granite.
Washing<br>
off the finer particles, we find the largest remaining grains
are<br>
composed of the all but indestructible quartz.</p>
<p>[1] Proc. Roy. Irish Acad., VIII., Ser. A, p. 21.</p>
<p>37</p>
<p>This also is from the granite. Some few of the grains are
of<br>
chalky-looking felspar; again a granitic mineral. What is the<br>
finer silt we have washed off? It, too, is composed of
mineral<br>
particles to a great extent; rock dust stained with iron
oxide<br>
and intermixed with organic remains, both animal and
vegetable.<br>
But if we make a chemical analysis of the finer silt we find
that<br>
the composition is by no means that of the granite beneath.
The<br>
chemist is able to say, from a study of his results, that
there<br>
has been, in the first place, a large loss of material
attending<br>
the conversion of the granite to the soil. He finds a<br>
concentration of certain of the more resistant substances of
the<br>
granite arising from the loss of the less resistant. Thus the<br>
percentage amount of alumina is increased. The percentage of
iron<br>
is also increased. But silica and most other substances show
a<br>
diminished percentage. Notably lime has nearly disappeared.
Soda<br>
is much reduced; so is magnesia. Potash is not so completely<br>
abstracted. Finally, owing to hydration, there is much more<br>
combined water in the soil than in the rock. This is a
typical<br>
result for rocks of this kind.</p>
<p>Deeper in the soil we often observe a change of texture. It
has<br>
become finer, and at the same time the clay is paler in
colour.<br>
This subsoil represents the finer particles carried by rain
from<br>
above. The change of colour is due to the state of the iron
which<br>
is less oxidised low down in the soil. Beneath the subsoil
the<br>
soil grows</p>
<p>38</p>
<p>again coarser. Finally, we recognise in it fragments of
granite<br>
which ever grow larger as we descend, till the soil has
become<br>
replaced by the loose and shattered rock. Beneath this the
only<br>
sign of weathering apparent in the rock is the rusty hue
imparted<br>
by the oxidised iron which the percolating rain has leached
from<br>
iron-bearing minerals.</p>
<p>The soil we have examined has plainly been derived in situ
from<br>
the underlying rock. It represents the more insoluble residue<br>
after water and acids have done their work. Each year there
must<br>
be a very slow sinking of the surface, but the ablation is<br>
infinitesimal.</p>
<p>The depth of such a soil may be considerable. The total
surface<br>
exposed by the countless grains of which it is composed is<br>
enormous. In a cubic foot of average soil the surface area of
the<br>
grains may be 50,000 square feet or more. Hence a soil only
two<br>
feet deep may expose 100,000 square feet for each square foot
of<br>
surface area.</p>
<p>It is true that soils formed in this manner by atmospheric
and<br>
organic actions take a very long time to grow. It must be<br>
remembered, however, that the process is throughout attended
by<br>
the removal in solution: of chemically altered materials.</p>
<p>Considerations such as the foregoing must convince us that
while<br>
the accumulation of the detrital sediments around the
continents<br>
is largely the result of activities progressing on the
steeper<br>
slopes of the land, that is,</p>
<p>39</p>
<p>among the mountainous regions, the feeding of the salts to
the<br>
ocean arises from the slower work of meteorological and
organic<br>
agencies attacking the molecular constitution of the rocks;<br>
processes which best proceed where the drainage is sluggish
and<br>
the quiescent conditions permit of the development of
abundant<br>
organic growth and decay.</p>
<p>Statistics of the solvent denudation of the continents
support<br>
this view. Within recent years a very large amount of work
has<br>
been expended on the chemical investigation of river waters
of<br>
America and of Europe. F. W. Clarke has, at the expense of
much<br>
labour, collected and compared these results. They are
expressed<br>
as so many tonnes removed in solution per square mile per
annum.<br>
For North America the result shows 79 tonnes so removed; for<br>
Europe 100 tonnes. Now there is a notable difference between
the<br>
mean elevations of these two continents. North America has a
mean<br>
elevation of 700 metres over sea level, whereas the mean<br>
elevation of Europe is but 300 metres. We see in these
figures<br>
that the more mountainous land supplies less dissolved matter
to<br>
the ocean than the land of lower elevation, as our study has
led<br>
us to expect.</p>
<p>We have now considered the source of the detrital sediments,
as<br>
well as of the dissolved matter which has given to the ocean,
in<br>
the course of geological time, its present gigantic load of<br>
salts. It is true there are further solvent and chemical
effects<br>
exerted by the sea water</p>
<p>40</p>
<p>upon the sediments discharged into it; but we are justified
in<br>
concluding that, relatively to the similar actions taking
place<br>
in the soils, the solvent and chemical work of the ocean is<br>
small. The fact is, the deposited detrital sediments around
the<br>
continents occupy an area small when contrasted with the vast<br>
stretches of the land. The area of deposition is much less
than<br>
that of denudation; probably hardly as much as one twentieth.<br>
And, again, the conditions of aeration and circulation which<br>
largely promote chemical and solvent denudation in the soils
are<br>
relatively limited and ineffective in the detrital oceanic<br>
deposits.</p>
<p>The summation of the amounts of dissolved and detrital
materials<br>
which denudation has brought into the ocean during the long<br>
denudative history of the Earth, as we might anticipate,
reveals<br>
quantities of almost unrealisable greatness. The facts are
among<br>
the most impressive which geological science has brought to<br>
light. Elsewhere in this volume they have been mentioned when<br>
discussing the age of the Earth. In the present connection,<br>
however, they are deserving of separate consideration.</p>
<p>The basis of our reasoning is that the ocean owes its
saltness<br>
mainly if not entirely to the denudative activities we have
been<br>
considering. We must establish this.</p>
<p>We may, in the first place, say that any other view at
once<br>
raises the greatest difficulties. The chemical composition of
the<br>
detrital sediments which are spread over</p>
<p>41</p>
<p>the continents and which build up the mountains, differs on
the<br>
average very considerably from that of the igneous rocks. We
know<br>
the former have been derived from the latter, and we know
that<br>
the difference in the composition of the two classes of
materials<br>
is due to the removal in solution of certain of the
constituents<br>
of the igneous rocks. But the ocean alone can have received
this<br>
dissolved matter. We know of no other place in which to look
for<br>
it. It is true that some part of this dissolved matter has
been<br>
again rejected by the ocean; thus the formation of limestone
is<br>
largely due to the abstraction of lime from sea water by
organic<br>
and other agencies. This, however, in no way relieves us of
the<br>
necessity of tracing to the ocean the substances dissolved
from<br>
the igneous rocks. It follows that we have here a very causa
for<br>
the saltness of the ocean. The view that the ocean "was salt
from<br>
the first" is without one known fact to support it, and leaves
us<br>
with the burden of the entire dissolved salts of geological
time<br>
to dispose of&mdash;Where and how?</p>
<p>The argument we have outlined above becomes convincingly
strong<br>
when examined more closely. For this purpose we first compare
the<br>
average chemical composition of the sedimentary and the
igneous<br>
rocks. The following table gives the percentages of the chief<br>
chemical constituents: [1]</p>

<p>In the derivation of the sediments from the igneous rocks
there<br>
is a loss by solution of about 33 per cent; _i.e._ 100 tons
of<br>
igneous rock yields rather less than 70 tons of sedimentary
rock.<br>
This involves a concentration in the sediments of the more<br>
insoluble constituents. To this rule the lime-content appears
to<br>
be an exception. It is not so in reality. Its high value in
the<br>
sediments is due to its restoration from the ocean to the
land.<br>
The magnesia and potash are, also, largely restored from the<br>
ocean; the former in dolomites and magnesian limestones; the<br>
latter in glauconite sands. The iron of the sediments shows<br>
increased oxidation. The most notable difference in the two<br>
analyses appears, however, in the soda percentages. This
falls<br>
from 3.41 in the igneous rock to 1.12 in the average
sediment.<br>
Indeed, this</p>
<p>43</p>
<p>deficiency of soda in sedimentary rocks is so characteristic
of<br>
secondary rocks that it may with some safety be applied to<br>
discriminate between the two classes of substances in cases
where<br>
petrological distinctions of other kinds break down.</p>
<p>To what is this so marked deficiency of soda to be ascribed?
It<br>
is a result of the extreme solubility of the salts of sodium
in<br>
water. This has not only rendered its deposition by evaporation
a<br>
relatively rare and unimportant incident of geological
history,<br>
but also has protected it from abstraction from the ocean by<br>
organic agencies. The element sodium has, in fact, accumulated
in<br>
the ocean during the whole of geological time.</p>
<p>We can use the facts associated with the accumulation of
sodium<br>
salts in the ocean as a means of obtaining additional support
to<br>
the view, that the processes of solvent denudation are<br>
responsible for the saltness of the ocean. The new evidence
may<br>
be stated as follows: Estimates of the amounts of sedimentary<br>
rock on the continents have repeatedly been made. It is true
that<br>
these estimates are no more than approximations. But they<br>
undoubtedly _are_ approximations, and as such may legitimately
be<br>
used in our argument; more especially as final agreement tends
to<br>
check and to support the several estimates which enter into<br>
them.</p>
<p>The most recent and probable estimates of the sediments on
the<br>
land assign an average thickness of one mile of</p>
<p>44</p>
<p>secondary rocks over the land area of the world. To this
some<br>
increase must be made to allow for similar materials concealed
in<br>
the ocean, principally around the continental margins. If we
add<br>
10 per cent. and assign a specific gravity of 2.5 we get as
the<br>
mass of the sediments 64 x 10<sup>16</sup> tonnes. But as this is
about 67<br>
per cent. of the parent igneous rock&mdash;_i.e._ the average
igneous<br>
rock from which the sediments are derived&mdash;we conclude that
the<br>
primary denuded rock amounted to a mass of about 95 x
10<sup>16</sup><br>
tonnes.</p>
<p>Now from the mean chemical composition of the secondary rocks
we<br>
calculate that the mass of sediments as above determined
contains<br>
0.72 x10<sup>16</sup> tonnes of the sodium oxide,
Na<sub>2</sub>O. If to this amount we<br>
add the quantity of sodium oxide which must have been given
to<br>
the ocean in order to account for the sodium salts contained<br>
therein, we arrive at a total quantity of oxide of sodium
which<br>
must be that possessed by the primary rock before denudation<br>
began its work upon it. The mass of the ocean being well<br>
ascertained, we easily calculate that the sodium in the ocean<br>
converted to sodium oxide amounts to 2.1 x 10<sup>16</sup>
tonnes. Hence<br>
between the estimated sediments and the waters of the ocean
we<br>
can account for 2.82 x 10<sup>16</sup> tonnes of soda. When now
we put this<br>
quantity back into the estimated mass of primary rock we find<br>
that it assigns to the primary rock a soda percentage of 3.0.
On<br>
the average analysis given above this should be 3.41 per
cent.<br>
The agreement,</p>
<p>45</p>
<p>all things considered, more especially the uncertainty in
the<br>
estimate of the sediments, is plainly in support of the view
that<br>
oceanic salts are derived from the rocks; if, indeed, it does
not<br>
render it a certainty.</p>
<p>A leading and fundamental inference in the denudative history
of<br>
the Earth thus finds support: indeed, we may say,
verification.<br>
In the light of this fact the whole work of denudation stands<br>
revealed. That the ocean began its history as a vast
fresh-water<br>
envelope of the Globe is a view which accords with the
evidence<br>
for the primitive high temperature of the Earth. Geological<br>
history opened with the condensation of an atmosphere of
immense<br>
extent, which, after long fluctuations between the states of<br>
steam and water, finally settled upon the surface, almost free
of<br>
matter in solution: an ocean of distilled water. The epoch of<br>
denudation then began. It will, probably, continue till the<br>
waters, undergoing further loss of thermal energy, suffer yet<br>
another change of state, when their circulation will cease
and<br>
their attack upon the rocks come to an end.</p>
<p>From what has been reviewed above it is evident that the
sodium<br>
in the ocean is an index of the total activity of denudation<br>
integrated over geological time. From this the broad facts of
the<br>
results of denudation admit of determination with
considerable<br>
accuracy. We can estimate the amount of rock which has been<br>
degraded by solvent and chemical actions, and the amount of<br>
sediments which has been derived from it. We are,</p>
<p>46</p>
<p>thus, able to amend our estimate of the sediments which,
as<br>
determined by direct observation, served to support the basis
of<br>
our argument.</p>
<p>We now go straight to the ocean for the amount of sodium
of<br>
denudative origin. There may, indeed, have been some
primitive<br>
sodium dissolved by a more rapid denudation while the Earth's<br>
surface was still falling in temperature. It can be shown,<br>
however, that this amount was relatively small. Neglecting it
we<br>
may say with safety that the quantity of sodium carried into
the<br>
ocean by the rivers must be between 14,000 and 15,000 million<br>
million tonnes: _i.e._ 14,500 x 10<sup>12</sup> tonnes, say.</p>
<p>Keeping the figures to round numbers we find that this amount
of<br>
sodium involves the denudation of about 80 x 10<sup>16</sup>
tonnes of<br>
average igneous rock to 53 x 1016 tonnes of average sediment.<br>
From these vast quantities we know that the parent rock
denuded<br>
during geological time amounted to some 300 million cubic<br>
kilometres or about seventy million cubic miles. The
sediments<br>
derived therefrom possessed a bulk of 220 million cubic<br>
kilometres or fifty million cubic miles. The area of the land<br>
surface of the Globe is 144 million square kilometres. The
parent<br>
rock would have covered this to a uniform depth of rather
more<br>
than two kilometres, and the derived sediment to more than
1.5<br>
kilometres, or about one mile deep.</p>
<p>The slow accomplishment of results so vast conveys some idea
of<br>
the great duration of geological time.</p>
<p>47</p>
<p>The foregoing method of investigating the statistics of
solvent<br>
denudation is capable of affording information not only as to
the<br>
amount of sediments upon the land, but also as to the
quantity<br>
which is spread over the floor of the ocean.</p>
<p>We see this when we follow the fate of the 33 per cent. of<br>
dissolved salts which has been leached from the parent
igneous<br>
rock, and the mass of which we calculate from the ascertained<br>
mass of the latter, to be 27 x 10<sup>16</sup> tonnes. This
quantity was at<br>
one time or another all in the ocean. But, as we saw above, a<br>
certain part of it has been again abstracted from solution,<br>
chiefly by organic agencies. Now the abstracted solids have
not<br>
been altogether retained beneath the ocean. Movements of the
land<br>
during geological time have resulted in some portion being<br>
uplifted along with other sediments. These substances
constitute,<br>
mainly, the limestones.</p>
<p>We see, then, that the 27 x 10<sup>16</sup> tonnes of
substances leached<br>
from the parent igneous rocks have had a threefold
destination.<br>
One part is still in solution; a second part has been<br>
precipitated to the bottom of the ocean; a third part exists
on<br>
the land in the form of calcareous rocks.</p>
<p>Observation on the land sediments shows that the calcareous
rocks<br>
amount to about 5 per cent. of the whole. From this we find
that<br>
3 x 10<sup>16</sup> tonnes, approximately, of such rocks have
been taken<br>
from the ocean. This accounts for one of the three classes of<br>
material</p>
<p>48</p>
<p>into which the original dissolved matter has been divided.<br>
Another of the three quantities is easily estimated: the
amount<br>
of matter still in solution in the ocean. The volume of the
ocean<br>
is 1,414 million cubic kilometres and its mass is 145 x
10<sup>16</sup><br>
tonnes. The dissolved salts in it constitute 3.4 per cent. of
its<br>
mass; or, rather more than 5 x 10<sup>16</sup> tonnes. The
limestones on the<br>
land and the salts in the sea water together make up about 8
x<br>
10<sup>16</sup> tonnes. If we, now, deduct this from the total of
27 x 10<sup>16</sup><br>
tonnes, we find that about 19 x 10<sup>16</sup> tonnes must exist
as<br>
precipitated matter on the floor of the ocean.</p>
<p>The area of the ocean is 367 x 10<sup>12</sup> square metres,
so that if the<br>
precipitated sediment possesses an average specific gravity
of<br>
2.5, it would cover the entire floor to a uniform depth of
218<br>
metres; that is 715 feet. This assumes that there was uniform<br>
deposition of the abstracted matter over the floor of the
ocean.<br>
Of course, this assumption is not justifiable. It is certain
that<br>
the rate of deposition on the floor of the sea has varied<br>
enormously with various conditions&mdash;principally with the
depth.<br>
Again, it must be remembered that this estimate takes no
account<br>
of solid materials otherwise brought into the oceanic
deposits;<br>
_e.g._, by wind-transported dust from the land or volcanic<br>
ejectamenta in the ocean depths. It is not probable, however,<br>
that any considerable addition to the estimated mean depth of<br>
deposit from such sources would be allowable.</p>
<p>49</p>
<p>The greatness of the quantities involved in these
determinations<br>
is almost awe inspiring. Take the case of the dissolved salts
in<br>
the ocean. They are but a fraction, as we have seen, of the
total<br>
results of solvent denudation and represent the integration
of<br>
the minute traces contributed by the river water. Yet the
common<br>
salt (chloride of sodium) alone, contained in the ocean,
would,<br>
if abstracted and spread over the dry land as a layer of rock<br>
salt having a specific gravity of 2.2, cover the whole to a
depth<br>
of 107 metres or 354 feet. The total salts in solution in the<br>
ocean similarly spread over the land would increase the depth
of<br>
the layer to 460 feet. After considering what this means we
have<br>
to remember that this amount of matter now in solution in the<br>
seas is, in point of fact, less than a fifth part of the
total<br>
dissolved from the rocks during geological time.</p>
<p>The transport by denudation of detrital and dissolved matter
from<br>
the land to the ocean has had a most important influence on
the<br>
events of geological history. The existing surface features
of<br>
the earth must have been largely conditioned by the dynamical<br>
effects arising therefrom. In dealing with the subject of<br>
mountain genesis we will, elsewhere, see that all the great<br>
mountain ranges have originated in the accumulation of the<br>
detrital sediments near the shore in areas which, in
consequence<br>
of the load, gradually became depressed and developed into<br>
synclines of many thousands of feet in depth. The most
impressive<br>
surface features of the Globe originated</p>
<p>50</p>
<p>in this manner. We will see too that these events were of
a<br>
rhythmic character; the upraising of the mountains involving<br>
intensified mechanical denudation over the elevated area and
in<br>
this way an accelerated transport of detritus to the sea; the<br>
formation of fresh deposits; renewed synclinal sinking of the
sea<br>
floor, and, finally, the upheaval of a younger mountain
range.<br>
This extraordinary sequence of events has been determined by
the<br>
events of detrital denudation acting along with certain
general<br>
conditions which have all along involved the growth of<br>
compressive stresses in the surface crust of the Earth.</p>
<p>The effects of purely solvent denudation are less easily
traced,<br>
but, very probably, they have been of not less importance. I<br>
refer here to the transport from the land to the sea of matter
in<br>
solution.</p>
<p>Solvent denudation, as observed above, takes place mainly in
the<br>
soils and in this way over the more level continental areas.
It<br>
has resulted in the removal from the land and transfer to the<br>
ocean of an amount of matter which represents a uniform layer
of<br>
one half a kilometre; that is of more than 1,600 feet of
rock.<br>
The continents have, during geological time, been lightened
to<br>
this extent. On the other hand all this matter has for the<br>
greater part escaped the geosynclines and become uniformly<br>
diffused throughout the ocean or precipitated over its floor<br>
principally on the continental slopes before the great depths
are<br>
reached. Of this material the ocean</p>
<p>51</p>
<p>waters contain in solution an amount sufficient to increase
their<br>
specific gravity by 2.7 per cent.</p>
<p>Taking the last point first, it is interesting to note the<br>
effects upon the bulk of the ocean which has resulted from
the<br>
matter dissolved in it. From the known density of average sea<br>
water we find that 100 ccs. of it weigh just 102.7 grammes.
Of<br>
this 3.5 per cent. by weight are solids in solution. That is
to<br>
say, 3.594 grammes. Hence the weight of water present is 99.1<br>
grammes, or a volume of 99.1 ccs. From this we see that the
salts<br>
present have increased the volume by 0.9 ccs. or 0.9 per
cent.</p>
<p>The average depth of the ocean is 2,000 fathoms or 3,700
metres.<br>
The increase of depth due to salts dissolved in the ocean has<br>
been, therefore, 108 feet or 33.24 metres. This result
assumes<br>
that there has been no increased elastic compression due to
the<br>
increased pressure, and no change of compressional elastic<br>
properties. We may be sure that the rise on the shore line of
the<br>
land has not been less than 100 feet.</p>
<p>We see then that as the result of solvent denudation we have
to<br>
do with a heavier and a deeper ocean, expanded in volume by<br>
nearly one per cent. and the floor of which has become raised,
on<br>
an average, about 700 feet by precipitated sediment.</p>
<p>One of the first conceptions, which the student of geology has
to<br>
dismiss from his mind, is that of the immobility or rigidity
of<br>
the Earth's crust. The lane, we live on sways even to the
gentle<br>
rise and fail of ocean tides</p>
<p>52</p>
<p>around the coasts. It suffers its own tidal oscillations due
to<br>
the moon's attractions. Large tracts of semi-liquid matter<br>
underlie it. There is every evidence that the raised features
of<br>
the Globe are sustained by such pressures acting over other
and<br>
adjacent areas as serve to keep them in equilibrium against
the<br>
force of gravity. This state of equilibrium, which was first<br>
recognised by Pratt, as part of the dynamics of the Earth's<br>
crust, has been named isostasy. The state of the crust is that
of<br>
"mobile equilibrium."</p>
<p>The transfer of matter from the exposed land surfaces to
the<br>
sub-oceanic slopes of the continents and the increase in the<br>
density of the ocean, must all along have been attended by<br>
isostatic readjustment. We cannot take any other view. On the
one<br>
hand the land was being lightened; on the other the sea was<br>
increasing in mass and depth and the flanks of the continents<br>
were being loaded with the matter removed from the land and
borne<br>
in solution to the ocean. How important the resulting
movements<br>
must have been may be gathered from the fact that the
existing<br>
land of the Globe stands at a mean elevation of no more than<br>
2,000 feet above sea level. We have seen that solvent
denudation<br>
removed over 1,600 feet of rock. But we have no evidence that
on<br>
the whole the elevation of land in the past was ever very<br>
different from what it now is.</p>
<p>We have, then, presented to our view the remarkable fact
that<br>
throughout the past, and acting with extreme</p>
<p>53</p>
<p>slowness, the land has steadily been melted down into the sea
and<br>
as steadily been upraised from the waters. It is possible
that<br>
the increased bulk of the ocean has led to a certain
diminution<br>
of the exposed land area. The point is a difficult one. One
thing<br>
we may without much risk assume. The sub-aereal current of<br>
dissolved matter from the land to the ocean was accompanied by
a<br>
sub-crustal flux from the ocean areas to the land areas; the<br>
heated viscous materials creeping from depths far beneath the<br>
ocean floor to depths beneath the roots of the mountains
which<br>
arose around the oceans. Such movements took ages for their<br>
accomplishment. Indeed, they have been, probably, continuous
all<br>
along and are still proceeding. A low degree of viscosity
will<br>
suffice to permit of movements so slow. Superimposed upon
these<br>
movements the rhythmic alternations of depression and
elevation<br>
of the geosynclines probably resulted in releasing the crust
from<br>
local accumulation of strains arising in the more rigid
surface<br>
materials. The whole sequence of movements presents an<br>
extraordinary picture of pseudo-vitality&mdash;reminding us of
the<br>
circulatory and respiratory systems of a vast organism.</p>
<p>All great results in our universe are founded in motions
and<br>
forces the most minute. In contemplating the Cause or the
Effect<br>
we stand equally impressed with the spectacle presented to us.
We<br>
shall now turn from the great effects of denudation upon the<br>
history and evolution of a world and consider for a moment<br>
activities</p>
<p>54</p>
<p>so minute in detail that their operations will probably for
ever<br>
elude our bodily senses, but which nevertheless have
necessarily<br>
affected and modified the great results we have been<br>
considering.</p>
<p>The ocean a little way from the land is generally so free
from<br>
suspended sediments that it has a blackness as of ink. This<br>
blackness is due to its absolute freedom from particles<br>
reflecting the sun's light. The beautiful blue of the Swiss
and<br>
Italian lakes is due to the presence of very fine particles<br>
carried into them by the rivers; the finest flour of the<br>
glaciers, which remain almost indefinitely suspended in the<br>
water. But in the ocean it is only in those places where
rapid<br>
currents running over shallows stir continually the sediments
or<br>
where the fresh water of a great river is carried far from
the<br>
land, that the presence of silt is to be observed. The
beautiful<br>
phenomenon of the coal-black sea is familiar to every
yachtsman<br>
who has sailed to the west of our Islands.[1]</p>
<p>There is, in fact, a very remarkable difference in the manner
of<br>
settlement of fine sediments in salt and in fresh water. We
are<br>
here brought into contact with one of those subtle yet<br>
influential natural actions the explanation of which involves<br>
scientific advance along many apparently unconnected lines of<br>
investigation.</p>
<p>[1] See Tyndall's Voyage to Algeria in _Fragments of Science._
The<br>
cause of the blue colour of the lakes has been discussed by<br>
various observers, not always with agreement.</p>
<p>55</p>
<p>It is easy to observe in the laboratory the fact of the
different<br>
behaviour of salt and fresh water towards finely divided<br>
substances. The nature of the insoluble substance is not<br>
important.</p>
<p>We place, in a good light, two glass vessels of equal
dimensions;<br>
the one filled with sea water, the other with fresh water.
Into<br>
each we stir the same weight of very finely powdered slate:
just<br>
so much as will produce a cloudiness. In a few hours we find
the<br>
sea water limpid. The fresh water is still cloudy, however;
and,<br>
indeed, may be hardly different in appearance from what it was
at<br>
starting. In itself this is a most extraordinary experiment.
We<br>
would have anticipated quite the opposite result owing to the<br>
greater density of the sea water.</p>
<p>But a still more interesting experiment remains to be
carried<br>
out. In the sea water we have many different salts in
solution.<br>
Let us see if these salts are equally responsible for the
result<br>
we have obtained. For this purpose we measure out quantities
of<br>
sodium chloride and magnesium chloride in the proportion in
which<br>
they exist in sea water: that is about as seven to one. We
add<br>
such an equal amount of water to each as represents the
dilution<br>
of these salts in sea water. Then finally we stir a little of
the<br>
finely powdered slate into each. It will be found that the<br>
magnesium chloride, although so much more dilute than the
sodium<br>
chloride, is considerably more active in clearing out the<br>
suspension. We may now try such marine salts as magnesium<br>
sulphate,</p>
<p>56</p>
<p>or calcium sulphate against sodium chloride; keeping the
marine<br>
proportions. Again we find that the magnesium and calcium
salts<br>
are the most effective, although so much more dilute than the<br>
sodium salt.</p>
<p>There is no visible clue to the explanation of these results.
But<br>
we must conclude as most probable that some action is at work
in<br>
the sea water and in the salt solutions which clumps or<br>
flocculates the sediment. For only by the gathering of the<br>
particles together in little aggregates can we explain their<br>
rapid fall to the bottom. It is not a question of viscosity<br>
(_i.e._ of resistance to the motion of the particles), for
the<br>
salt solutions are rather more viscous than the fresh water.<br>
Still more remarkable is the fact that every dissolved
substance<br>
will not bring about the result. Thus if we dissolve sugar in<br>
water we find that, if anything, the silt settles more slowly
in<br>
the sugar solution than in fresh water.</p>
<p>Now there is one effect produced by the solution of such salts
as<br>
we have dealt with which is not produced by such bodies as
sugar.<br>
The water is rendered a conductor of electricity. Long ago<br>
Faraday explained this as due to the presence of free atoms
of<br>
the dissolved salt in the solution, carrying electric charges.
We<br>
now speak of the salt as "ionised." That is it is partly split
up<br>
into ions or free electrified atoms of chlorine, sodium,<br>
magnesium, etc., according to the particular salt in
solution.<br>
This fact leads us to think that these electrified</p>
<p>57</p>
<p>atoms moving about in the solution may be the cause of the<br>
clumping or flocculation. Such electrified atoms are absent
from<br>
the sugar solution: sugar does not become "ionised" when it
is<br>
dissolved.</p>
<p>The suspicion that the free electrified atoms play a part in
the<br>
phenomenon is strengthened when we recall the remarkable<br>
difference in the action of sodium chloride and magnesium<br>
chloride. In each of the solutions of these substances there
are<br>
free chlorine atoms each of which carries a single charge of<br>
negative electricity. As these atoms are alike in both
solutions<br>
the different behaviour of the solutions cannot be due to the<br>
chlorine. But the metallic atom is very different in the two<br>
cases. The ionised sodium atom is known to be _monad_ or
carries<br>
but _one_ positive charge; whereas the magnesium atom is _diad_
and<br>
carries _two_ positive charges. If, then, we assume that the<br>
metallic, positively electrified atom is in each case<br>
responsible, we have something to go on. It may be now stated<br>
that it has been found by experiment and supported by theory
that<br>
the clumping power of an ion rises very rapidly with its
valency;<br>
that is with the number of unit charges associated with it.
Thus<br>
diads such as magnesium, calcium, barium, etc., are very much<br>
more efficient than monads such as sodium, potassium, etc.,
and<br>
again, triads such as aluminium are, similarly, very much
more<br>
powerful than diad atoms. Here, in short, we have arrived at
the<br>
active cause of the phenomenon. Its inner mechanism</p>
<p>58</p>
<p>is, however, harder to fathom. A plausible explanation can
be<br>
offered, but a study of it would take us too far. Sufficient
has<br>
been said to show the very subtile nature of the forces at
work.</p>
<p>We have here an effect due to the sea salts derived by
denudation<br>
from the land which has been slowly augmenting during
geological<br>
time. It is certain that the ocean was practically fresh water
in<br>
remote ages. During those times the silt from the great
rivers<br>
would have been carried very far from the land. A Mississippi
of<br>
those ages would have sent its finer suspensions far abroad on
a<br>
contemporary Gulf stream: not improbably right across the<br>
Atlantic. The earlier sediments of argillaceous type were not<br>
collected in the geosynclines and the genesis of the
mountains<br>
was delayed proportionately. But it was, probably, not for
very<br>
long that such conditions prevailed. For the accumulation of<br>
calcium salts must have been rapid, and although the great<br>
salinity due to sodium salts was of slow growth the salts of
the<br>
diad element calcium must have soon introduced the cooperation
of<br>
the ion in the work of building the mountain.</p>
<p>59</p>
<p><u>THE ABUNDANCE OF LIFE</u> [1]</p>
<p>WE had reached the Pass of Tre Croci[2]and from a point a
little<br>
below the summit, looked eastward over the glorious Val
Buona.<br>
The pines which clothed the floor and lower slopes of the
valley,<br>
extended their multitudes into the furthest distance, among
the<br>
many recesses of the mountains, and into the confluent Val di<br>
Misurina. In the sunshine the Alpine butterflies flitted from<br>
stone to stone. The ground at our feet and everywhere
throughout<br>
the forests teamed with the countless millions of the small
black<br>
ants.</p>
<p>It was a magnificent display of vitality; of the
aggressiveness<br>
of vitality, assailing the barren heights of the limestone,<br>
wringing a subsistence from dead things. And the question<br>
suggested itself with new force: why the abundance of life
and<br>
its unending activity?</p>
<p>In trying to answer this question, the present sketch<br>
originated.</p>
<p>I propose to refer for an answer to dynamic considerations. It
is<br>
apparent that natural selection can only be concerned in a<br>
secondary way. Natural selection defines</p>
<p>[1] Proc. Roy. Dublin Soc., vol. vii., 1890.</p>
<p>[2] In the Dolomites of Southeast Tyrol; during the summer
of<br>
1890. Much of what follows was evolved in discussion with my<br>
fellow-traveller, Henry H. Dixon. Much of it is his.</p>
<p>60</p>
<p>a certain course of development for the organism; but very<br>
evidently some property of inherent progressiveness in the<br>
organism must be involved. The mineral is not affected by
natural<br>
selection to enter on a course of continual variation and<br>
multiplication. The dynamic relations of the organism with
the<br>
environment are evidently very different from those of
inanimate<br>
nature.</p>
<p>GENERAL DYNAMIC CONDITIONS ATTENDING INANIMATE ACTIONS</p>
<p>It is necessary, in the first place, to refer briefly to
the<br>
phenomena attending the transfer of energy within and into<br>
inanimate material systems. It is not assumed here that these<br>
phenomena are restricted in their sphere of action to
inanimate<br>
nature. It is, in fact, very certain that they are not; but
while<br>
they confer on dead nature its own dynamic tendencies, it
will<br>
appear that their effects are by various means evaded in
living<br>
nature. We, therefore, treat of them as characteristic of<br>
inanimate actions. We accept as fundamental to all the<br>
considerations which follow the truth of the principle of the<br>
Conservation of Energy.[1]</p>
<p>[1] "The principle of the Conservation of Energy has acquired
so<br>
much scientific weight during the last twenty years that no<br>
physiologist would feel any confidence in an experiment which<br>
showed a considerable difference between the work done by the<br>
animal and the balance of the account of Energy received and<br>
spent."&mdash;Clerk Maxwell, _Nature_, vol. xix., p. 142. See
also<br>
Helmholtz _On the Conservation of Force._</p>
<p>61</p>
<p>Whatever speculations may be made as to the course of events
very<br>
distant from us in space, it appears certain that dissipation
of<br>
energy is at present actively progressing throughout our
sphere<br>
of observation in inanimate nature. It follows, in fact, from
the<br>
second law of thermodynamics, that whenever work is derived
from<br>
heat, a certain quantity of heat falls in potential without
doing<br>
work or, in short, is dissipated. On the other hand, work may
be<br>
entirely converted into heat. The result is the heat-tendency
of<br>
the universe. Heat, being an undirected form of energy, seeks,
as<br>
it were, its own level, so that the result of this
heat-tendency<br>
is continual approach to uniformity of potential.</p>
<p>The heat-tendency of the universe is also revealed in the<br>
far-reaching "law of maximum work," which defines that
chemical<br>
change, accomplished without the intervention of external
energy,<br>
tends to the production of the body, or system of bodies,
which<br>
disengage the greatest quantity of heat.[1] And, again, vast<br>
numbers of actions going on throughout nature are attended by<br>
dissipatory thermal effects, as those arising from the motions
of<br>
proximate molecules (friction, viscosity), and from the fall
of<br>
electrical potential.</p>
<p>Thus, on all sides, the energy which was once most
probably<br>
existent in the form of gravitational potential, is being<br>
dissipated into unavailable forms. We must</p>
<p>[1] Berthelot, _Essai de M&eacute;canique Chimique._</p>
<p>62</p>
<p>recognize dissipation as an inevitable attendant on
inanimate<br>
transfer of energy.</p>
<p>But when we come to consider inanimate actions in relation
to<br>
time, or time-rate of change, we find a new feature in the<br>
phenomena attending transfer of energy; a feature which is
really<br>
involved in general statements as to the laws of physical<br>
interactions.[1] It is seen, that the attitude of inanimate<br>
material systems is very generally, if not in all cases,<br>
retardative of change&mdash;opposing it by effects generated by
the<br>
primary action, which may be called "secondary" for
convenience.<br>
Further, it will be seen that these secondary effects are
those<br>
concerned in bringing about the inevitable dissipation.</p>
<p>As example, let us endeavour to transfer gravitational
potential<br>
energy contained in a mass raised above the surface of the
Earth<br>
into an elastic body, which we can put into compression by<br>
resting the weight upon it. In this way work is done against<br>
elastic force and stored as elastic potential energy. We may
deal<br>
with a metal spring, or with a mass of gas contained in a<br>
cylinder fitted with a piston upon which the weight may be<br>
placed. In either case we find the effect of compression is
to<br>
raise the temperature of the substance, thus causing its</p>
<p>[1] Helmholtz, _Ice and Glaciers._ Atkinson's collection of
his<br>
Popular Lectures. First Series, p.120. Quoted by Tate,
_Heat_,<br>
p. 311.</p>
<p>63</p>
<p>expansion or increased resistance to the descent of the
weight.<br>
And this resistance continues, with diminishing intensity,
till<br>
all the heat generated is dissipated into the surrounding
medium.<br>
The secondary effect thus delays the final transfer of
energy.</p>
<p>Again, if we suppose the gas in the cylinder replaced by a
vapour<br>
in a state of saturation, the effect of increased pressure, as
of<br>
a weight placed upon the piston, is to reduce the vapour to a<br>
liquid, thereby bringing about a great diminution of volume
and<br>
proportional loss of gravitational potential by the weight.
But<br>
this change will by no means be brought about
instantaneously.<br>
When a little of the vapour is condensed, this portion parts
with<br>
latent heat of vaporisation, increasing the tension of the<br>
remainder, or raising its point of saturation, so that before
the<br>
weight descends any further, this heat has to escape from the<br>
cylinder.</p>
<p>Many more such cases might be cited. The heating of
india-rubber<br>
when expanded, its cooling when compressed, is a remarkable
one;<br>
for at first sight it appears as if this must render it<br>
exceptional to the general law, most substances exhibiting
the<br>
opposite thermal effects when stressed. However, here, too,
the<br>
action of the stress is opposed by the secondary effects<br>
developed in the substance; for it is found that this
substance<br>
contracts when heated, expands when cooled. Again, ice being
a<br>
substance which contracts in melting, the effect of pressure
is<br>
to facilitate melting, lowering its freezing point. But</p>
<p>64</p>
<p>so soon as a little melting occurs, the resulting liquid calls
on<br>
the residual ice for an amount of heat equivalent to the
latent<br>
heat of liquefaction, and so by cooling the whole, retards
the<br>
change.</p>
<p>Such particular cases illustrate a principle controlling
the<br>
interaction of matter and energy which seems universal in<br>
application save when evaded, as we shall see, by the
ingenuity<br>
of life. This principle is not only revealed in the researches
of<br>
the laboratory; it is manifest in the history of worlds and
solar<br>
systems. Thus, consider the effects arising from the
aggregation<br>
of matter in space under the influence of the mutual
attraction<br>
of the particles. The tendency here is loss of gravitational<br>
potential. The final approach is however retarded by the<br>
temperature, or vis viva of the parts attending collision and<br>
compression. From this cause the great suns of space radiate
for<br>
ages before the final loss of potential is attained.</p>
<p>Clerk Maxwell[1] observes on the general principle that
less<br>
force is required to produce a change in a body when the
change<br>
is unopposed by constraints than when it is subjected to
such.<br>
From this if we assume the external forces acting upon a
system<br>
not to rise above a certain potential (which is the order of<br>
nature), the constraints of secondary actions may, under
certain<br>
circumstances, lead to final rejection of some of the energy,
or,<br>
in any</p>
<p>[1] _Theory of Heat_, p. 131.</p>
<p>65</p>
<p>case, to retardation of change in the system&mdash;dissipation
of<br>
energy being the result.[1]</p>
<p>As such constraints seem inherently present in the properties
of<br>
matter, we may summarise as follows:</p>
<p>_The transfer of energy into any inanimate material system
is<br>
attended by effects retardative to the transfer and conducive
to<br>
dissipation._</p>
<p>Was this the only possible dynamic order ruling in
material<br>
systems it is quite certain the myriads of ants and pines
never<br>
could have been, except all generated by creative act at vast<br>
primary expenditure of energy. Growth and reproduction would
have<br>
been impossible in systems which retarded change at every
step<br>
and never proceeded in any direction but in that of
dissipation.<br>
Once created, indeed, it is conceivable that, as heat
engines,<br>
they might have dragged out an existence of alternate life
and<br>
death; life in the hours of sunshine, death in hours of
darkness:<br>
no final death, however, their lot, till their parts were
simply<br>
worn out by long use, never made good by repair. But the<br>
sustained and increasing activity of organized nature is a
fact;<br>
therefore some other order of events must be possible.</p>
<p>[1] The law of Least Action, which has been applied, not alone
in<br>
optics, but in many mechanical systems, appears physically
based<br>
upon the restraint and retardation opposing the transfer of<br>
energy in material systems.</p>
<p>66</p>
<p>GENERAL DYNAMIC CONDITIONS ATTENDING ANIMATE ACTIONS</p>
<p>What is the actual dynamic attitude of the primary organic<br>
engine&mdash;the vegetable organism? We consider, here, in the
first<br>
place, not intervening, but resulting phenomena.</p>
<p>The young leaf exposed to solar radiation is small at first,
and<br>
the quantity of radiant energy it receives in unit of time
cannot<br>
exceed that which falls upon its surface. But what is the
effect<br>
of this energy? Not to produce a retardative reaction, but an<br>
accelerative response: for, in the enlarging of the leaf by<br>
growth, the plant opens for itself new channels of supply.</p>
<p>If we refer to "the living protoplasm which, with its
unknown<br>
molecular arrangement, is the only absolute test of the cell
and<br>
of the organism in general,[1] we find a similar attitude
towards<br>
external sources of available energy. In the act of growth<br>
increased rate of assimilation is involved, so that there is
an<br>
acceleration of change till a bulk of maximum activity is<br>
attained. The surface, finally, becomes too small for the<br>
absorption of energy adequate to sustain further increase of
mass<br>
(Spencer[2]), and the acceleration ceases. The waste going on
in<br>
the central parts is then just balanced by the renewal at the<br>
surface. By division, by spreading of the mass, by</p>
<p>[1] Claus, _Zoology_, p. 13.</p>
<p>[2] Geddes and Thomson, _The Evolution of Sex_, p. 220.</p>
<p>67</p>
<p>out-flowing processes, the normal activity of growth may
be<br>
restored. Till this moment nothing would be gained by any of<br>
these changes. One or other of them is now conducive to<br>
progressive absorption of energy by the organism, and one or<br>
other occurs, most generally the best of them, subdivision.
Two<br>
units now exist; the total mass immediately on division is<br>
unaltered, but paths for the more abundant absorption of
energy<br>
are laid open.</p>
<p>The encystment of the protoplasm (occurring under conditions
upon<br>
which naturalists do not seem agreed[1]) is to all appearance<br>
protective from an unfavourable environment, but it is often
a<br>
period of internal change as well, resulting in a segregation<br>
within the mass of numerous small units, followed by a breakup
of<br>
the whole into these units. It is thus an extension of the
basis<br>
of supply, and in an impoverished medium, where unit of
surface<br>
is less active, is evidently the best means of preserving a<br>
condition of progress.</p>
<p>Thus, in the organism which forms the basis of all modes of
life,<br>
a definite law of action is obeyed under various circumstances
of<br>
reaction with the available energy of its environment.</p>
<p>Similarly, in the case of the more complex leaf, we see, not
only<br>
in the phenomenon of growth, but in its extension in a
flattened<br>
form, and in the orientation of greatest surface towards the<br>
source of energy, an attitude towards</p>
<p>[1] However, "In no way comparable with death." Weismann,<br>
_Biological Memoirs_, p. 158.</p>
<p>68</p>
<p>available energy causative of accelerated transfer. There
is<br>
seemingly a principle at work, leading to the increase of
organic<br>
activity.</p>
<p>Many other examples might be adduced. The gastrula stage in
the<br>
development of embryos, where by invagination such an
arrangement<br>
of the multiplying cells is secured as to offer the greatest<br>
possible surface consistent with a first division of labour;
the<br>
provision of cilia for drawing upon the energy supplies of
the<br>
medium; and more generally the specialisation of organs in
the<br>
higher developments of life, may alike be regarded as efforts
of<br>
the organism directed to the absorption of energy. When any<br>
particular organ becomes unavailing in the obtainment of<br>
supplies, the organ in the course of time becomes aborted or<br>
disappears.[1] On the other hand, when a too ready and
liberal<br>
supply renders exertion and specialisation unnecessary, a
similar<br>
abortion of functionless organs takes place. This is seen in
the<br>
degraded members of certain parasites.</p>
<p>During certain epochs of geological history, the vegetable
world<br>
developed enormously; in response probably to liberal supplies
of<br>
carbon dioxide. A structural adaptation to the rich
atmosphere<br>
occurred, such as was calculated to cooperate in rapidly<br>
consuming the supplies, and to this obedience to a law of<br>
progressive transfer of energy we owe the vast stores of
energy<br>
now accumulated</p>
<p>[1] Claus, _Zoology_, p. 157</p>
<p>69</p>
<p>in our coal fields. And when, further, we reflect that this
store<br>
of energy had long since been dissipated into space but for
the<br>
intervention of the organism, we see definitely another factor
in<br>
organic transfer of energy&mdash;a factor acting conservatively
of<br>
energy, or antagonistically to dissipation.</p>
<p>The tendency of organized nature in the presence of
unlimited<br>
supplies is to "run riot." This seems so universal a
relation,<br>
that we are safe in seeing here cause and effect, and in
drawing<br>
our conclusions as to the attitude of the organism towards<br>
available energy. New species, when they come on the field of<br>
geological history, armed with fresh adaptations,
irresistible<br>
till the slow defences of the subjected organisms are
completed,<br>
attain enormous sizes under the stimulus of abundant supply,
till<br>
finally, the environment, living and dead, reacts upon them
with<br>
restraining influence. The exuberance of the organism in
presence<br>
of energy is often so abundant as to lead by deprivation to
its<br>
self-destruction. Thus the growth of bacteria is often
controlled<br>
by their own waste products. A moment's consideration shows
that<br>
such progressive activity denotes an accelerative attitude on
the<br>
part of the organism towards the transfer of energy into the<br>
organic material system. Finally, we are conscious in
ourselves<br>
how, by use, our faculties are developed; and it is apparent
that<br>
all such progressive developments must rest on actions which<br>
respond to supplies with fresh demands. Possibly in the
present<br>
and ever-</p>
<p>70</p>
<p>increasing consumption of inanimate power by civilised races,
we<br>
see revealed the dynamic attitude of the organism working
through<br>
thought-processes.</p>
<p>Whether this be so or not, we find generally in organised
nature<br>
causes at work which in some way lead to a progressive
transfer<br>
of energy into the organic system. And we notice, too, that
all<br>
is not spent, but both immediately in the growth of the<br>
individual, and ultimately in the multiplication of the
species,<br>
there are actions associated with vitality which retard the<br>
dissipation of energy. We proceed to state the dynamical<br>
principles involved in these manifestations, which appear<br>
characteristic of the organism, as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>_The transfer of energy into any animate material system
is<br>
attended by effects conducive to the transfer, and retardative
of<br>
dissipation._</p>
<p>This statement is, I think, perfectly general. It has been
in<br>
part advanced before, but from the organic more than the
physical<br>
point of view. Thus, "hunger is an essential characteristic
of<br>
living matter"; and again, "hunger is a dominant
characteristic<br>
of living matter,"[1] are, in part, expressions of the
statement.<br>
If it be objected against the generality of the statement,
that<br>
there are periods in the life of individuals when stagnation
and<br>
decay make their appearance, we may answer, that</p>
<p>[1] _Evolution of Sex._ Geddes and Thomson, chap. xvi. See
also a<br>
reference to Cope's theory of "Growth Force," in Wallace's<br>
_Darwinism_, p. 425.</p>
<p>71</p>
<p>such phenomena arise in phases of life developed under
conditions<br>
of external constraint, as will be urged more fully further
on,<br>
and that in fact the special conditions of old age do not and<br>
cannot express the true law and tendency of the dynamic
relations<br>
of life in the face of its evident advance upon the Earth.
The<br>
law of the unconstrained cell is growth on an ever increasing<br>
scale; and although we assume the organic configuration,
whether<br>
somatic or reproductive, to be essentially unstable, so that<br>
continual inflow of energy is required merely to keep it in<br>
existence, this does not vitiate the fact that, when free of
all<br>
external constraint, growth gains on waste. Indeed, even in
the<br>
case of old age, the statement remains essentially true, for
the<br>
phenomena then displayed point to a breakdown of the
functioning<br>
power of the cell, an approximation to configurations
incapable<br>
of assimilation. It is not as if life showed in these
phenomena<br>
that its conditions could obtain in the midst of abundance,
and<br>
yet its law be suspended; but as if they represented a<br>
degradation of the very conditions of life, a break up, under
the<br>
laws of the inanimate, of the animate contrivance; so that
energy<br>
is no longer available to it, or the primary condition, "the<br>
transfer of energy into the animate system," is imperfectly<br>
obeyed. It is to the perfect contrivance of life our
statement<br>
refers.</p>
<p>That the final end of all will be general non-availability
there<br>
seems little reason to doubt, and the organism, itself
dependent<br>
upon differences of potential, cannot</p>
<p>72</p>
<p>hope to carry on aggregation of energy beyond the period
when<br>
differences of potential are not. The organism is not
accountable<br>
for this. It is being affected by events external to it, by
the<br>
actions going on through inanimate agents. And although there
be<br>
only a part of the received energy preserved, there is a part<br>
preserved, and this amount is continually on the increase. To
see<br>
this it is only necessary to reflect that the sum of animate<br>
energy&mdash;capability of doing work in any way through
animate<br>
means&mdash;at present upon the Earth, is the result, although a
small<br>
one, of energy reaching the Earth since a remote period, and<br>
which otherwise had been dissipated in space. In inanimate<br>
actions throughout nature, as we know it, the availability is<br>
continually diminishing. The change is all the one way. As,<br>
however, the supply of available energy in the universe is<br>
(probably) limited in amount, we must look upon the two as
simply<br>
effecting the final dissipation of potential in very
different<br>
ways. The animate system is aggressive on the energy available
to<br>
it, spends with economy, and invests at interest till death<br>
finally deprives it of all. It has heirs, indeed, who inherit<br>
some of its gains, but they, too, must die, and ultimately
there<br>
will be no successors, and the greater part must melt away as
if<br>
it had never been. The inanimate system responds to the
forces<br>
imposed upon it by sluggish changes; of that which is thrust
upon<br>
it, it squanders uselessly. The path of the energy is very<br>
different in the two cases.</p>
<p>73</p>
<p>While it is true generally that both systems ultimately result
in<br>
the dissipation of energy to uniform potential, the organism
can,<br>
as we have seen, under particular circumstances evade the
final<br>
doom altogether. It can lay up a store of potential energy
which<br>
may be permanent. Thus, so long as there is free oxygen in
the<br>
universe, our coalfields might, at any time in the remote
future,<br>
generate light and heat in the universal grave.</p>
<p>It is necessary to observe on the fundamental distinction
between<br>
the growth of the protoplasm and the growth of the crystal. It
is<br>
common to draw comparison between the two, and to point to<br>
metabolism as the chief distinction. But while this is the
most<br>
obvious distinction the more fundamental one remains in the<br>
energy relations of the two with the environment.[1] The
growth<br>
of the crystal is the result of loss of energy; that of the<br>
organism the result of gain of energy. The crystal represents
a<br>
last position of stable equilibrium assumed by molecules upon
a<br>
certain loss of kinetic energy, and the formation of the
crystal<br>
by evaporation and concentration of a liquid does not, in its<br>
dynamic aspect, differ much from the precipitation of an<br>
amorphous sediment. The organism, on the other hand, represents
a<br>
more or less unstable condition formed and maintained by
inflow<br>
of energy; its formation, indeed, often attended with a loss
of<br>
kinetic energy (fixation of carbon in plants), but, if so,<br>
accompanied by</p>
<p>[1] It appears exceptional for the crystal line configuration
to<br>
stand higher in the scale of energy than the amorphous.</p>
<p>74</p>
<p>a more than compensatory increase of potential molecular
energy.</p>
<p>Thus, between growth in the living world and growth in the
dead<br>
world, the energy relations with the environment reveal a
marked<br>
contrast. Again, in the phenomena of combustion, there are<br>
certain superficial resemblances which have led to comparison<br>
between the two. Here again, however, the attitudes towards
the<br>
energy of the environment stand very much as + and -. The
life<br>
absorbs, stores, and spends with economy. The flame only<br>
recklessly spends. The property of storage by the organism
calls<br>
out a further distinction between the course of the two<br>
processes. It secures that the chemical activity of the
organism<br>
can be propagated in a medium in which the supply of energy
is<br>
discontinuous or localised. The chemical activity of the<br>
combustion can, strictly speaking, only be propagated among<br>
contiguous particles. I need not dwell on the latter fact; an<br>
example of the former is seen in the action of the roots of<br>
plants, which will often traverse a barren place or circumvent
an<br>
obstacle in their search for energy. In this manner roots
will<br>
find out spots of rich nutriment.</p>
<p>Thus there is a dynamic distinction between the progress of
the<br>
organism and the progress of the combustion, or of the
chemical<br>
reaction generally. And although there be unstable chemical<br>
systems which absorb energy during reaction, these are<br>
(dynamically) no more than the expansion of the compressed
gas.<br>
There is a certain</p>
<p>75</p>
<p>initial capacity in the system for a given quantity of
energy;<br>
this satisfied, progress ceases. The progress of the organism
in<br>
time is continual, and goes on from less to greater so long
as<br>
its development is unconstrained and the supply of energy is<br>
unlimited.</p>
<p>We must regard the organism as a configuration which is so<br>
contrived as to evade the tendency of the universal laws of<br>
nature. Except we are prepared to believe that a violation of
the<br>
second law of thermodynamics occurs in the organism, that a<br>
"sorting demon" is at work within it, we must, I think,
assume<br>
that the interactions going on among its molecules are<br>
accompanied by retardation and dissipation like the rest of<br>
nature. That such conditions are not incompatible with the<br>
definition of the dynamic attitude of the organism, can be
shown<br>
by analogy with our inanimate machines which, by aid of<br>
hypotheses in keeping with the second law of thermodynamics,
may<br>
be supposed to fulfil the energy-functions of the plant or<br>
animal, and, in fact, in all apparent respects conform to the<br>
definition of the organism.</p>
<p>We may assume this accomplished by a contrivance of the nature
of<br>
a steam-engine, driven by solar energy. It has a boiler, which
we<br>
may suppose fed by the action of the engine. It has piston,<br>
cranks, and other movable parts, all subject to resistance
from<br>
friction, etc. Now there is no reason why this engine should
not<br>
expend its surplus energy in shaping, fitting, and starting
into<br>
action other engines:&mdash;in fact, in reproductive sacrifice.
All</p>
<p>76</p>
<p>these other engines represent a multiplied absorption of
energy<br>
as the effects of the energy received by the parent engine,
and<br>
may in time be supposed to reproduce themselves. Further, we
may<br>
suppose the parent engine to be small and capable of
developing<br>
very little power, but the whole series as increasing in power
at<br>
each generation. Thus the primary energy relations of the<br>
vegetable organism are represented in these engines, and no<br>
violation of the second law of thermodynamics involved.</p>
<p>We might extend the analogy, and assuming these engines to
spend<br>
a portion of their surplus energy in doing work against
chemical<br>
forces&mdash;as, for example, by decomposing water through
the<br>
intervention of a dynamo&mdash;suppose them to lay up in this way
a<br>
store of potential energy capable of heating the boilers of a<br>
second order of engines, representing the graminivorous
animal.<br>
It is obvious without proceeding to a tertiary or carnivorous<br>
order, that the condition of energy in the animal world may
be<br>
supposed fulfilled in these successive series of engines, and
no<br>
violation of the principles governing the actions going on in
our<br>
machines assumed. Organisms evolving on similar principles
would<br>
experience loss at every transfer. Thus only a portion of the<br>
radiant energy absorbed by the leaf would be expended in
actual<br>
work, chemical and gravitational, etc. It is very certain
that<br>
this is, in fact, what takes place.</p>
<p>It is, perhaps, worth passing observation that, from the<br>
nutritive dependence of the animal upon the vegetable,</p>
<p>77</p>
<p>and the fact that a conversion of the energy of the one to
the<br>
purposes of the other cannot occur without loss, the mean
energy<br>
absorbed daily by the vegetable for the purpose of growth
must<br>
greatly exceed that used in animal growth; so that the
chemical<br>
potential energy of vegetation upon the earth is much greater<br>
than the energy of all kinds represented in the animal<br>
configurations.[1] It appears, too, that in the power
possessed<br>
by the vegetable of remaining comparatively inactive, of<br>
surviving hard times by the expenditure and absorption of but<br>
little, the vegetable constitutes a veritable reservoir for
the<br>
uniform supply of the more unstable and active animal.</p>
<p>Finally, on the question of the manner of origin of
organic<br>
systems, it is to be observed that, while the life of the
present<br>
is very surely the survival of the fittest of the tendencies
and<br>
chances of the past, yet, in the initiation of the organised<br>
world, a single chance may have decided a whole course of
events:<br>
for, once originated, its own law secures its increase,
although<br>
within the new order of actions, the law of the fittest must<br>
assert itself. That such a progressive material system as an<br>
organism was possible, and at some remote period was
initiated,<br>
is matter of knowledge; whether or not the initiatory living<br>
configuration was rare and fortuitous, or the probable result
of<br>
the general action of physical laws acting among innumerable<br>
chances, must remain matter of</p>
<p>[1] I find a similar conclusion arrived at in Semper's
_Animal<br>
Life_, p. 52.</p>
<p>78</p>
<p>speculation. In the event of the former being the truth, it
is<br>
evidently possible, in spite of a large finite number of<br>
habitable worlds, that life is non-existent elsewhere. If the<br>
latter is the truth, it is almost certain that there is life
in<br>
all, or many of those worlds.</p>
<p>EVOLUTION AND ACCELERATION OF ACTIVITY</p>
<p>The primary factor in evolution is the "struggle for
existence."<br>
This involves a "natural selection" among the many variations
of<br>
the organism. If we seek the underlying causes of the
struggle,<br>
we find that the necessity of food and (in a lesser degree)
the<br>
desire for a mate are the principal causes of contention. The<br>
former is much the more important factor, and, accordingly,
we<br>
find the greater degree of specialisation based upon it.</p>
<p>The present view assumes a dynamic necessity for its
demands<br>
involved in the nature of the organism as such. This
assumption<br>
is based on observation of the outcome of its unconstrained<br>
growth, reproduction, and life-acts. We have the same right
to<br>
assert this of the organism as we have to assert that
retardation<br>
and degradation attend the actions of inanimate machines,
which<br>
assertion, also, is based on observation of results. Thus we
pass<br>
from the superficial statements that organisms require food
in<br>
order to live, or that organisms desire food, to the more<br>
fundamental one that:</p>
<p>_The organism is a configuration of matter which absorbs
energy<br>
acceleratively, without limit, when unconstrained._</p>
<p>79</p>
<p>This is the dynamic basis for a "struggle for existence."
The<br>
organism being a material system responding to accession of<br>
energy with fresh demands, and energy being limited in
amount,<br>
the struggle follows as a necessity. Thus, evolution guiding'
the<br>
steps of the energy-seeking organism, must presuppose and
find<br>
its origin in that inherent property of the organism which<br>
determines its attitude in presence of available energy.</p>
<p>Turning to the factor, "adaptation," we find that this also
must<br>
presuppose, in order to be explicable, some quality of<br>
aggressiveness on the part of the organism. For adaptation in<br>
this or that direction is the result of repulse or victory,
and,<br>
therefore, we must presuppose an attack. The attack is made
by<br>
the organism in obedience to its law of demand; we see in the<br>
adaptation of the organism but the accumulated wisdom derived<br>
from past defeats and victories.</p>
<p>Where the environment is active, that is living,
adaptation<br>
occurs on both sides. Improved means of defence or improved
means<br>
of attack, both presuppose activity. Thus the reactions to
the<br>
environment, animate and inanimate, are at once the outcome
of<br>
the eternal aggressiveness of the organism, and the source of<br>
fresh aggressiveness upon the resources of the medium.</p>
<p>As concerns the "survival of the fittest" (or "natural<br>
selection"), we can, I think, at once conclude that the
organism<br>
which best fulfils the organic law under the circumstances of<br>
supply is the "fittest," _ipso facto._ In many</p>
<p>80</p>
<p>cases this is contained in the commonsense consideration, that
to<br>
be strong, consistent with concealment from enemies which are<br>
stronger, is best, as giving the organism mastery over foes
which<br>
are weaker, and generally renders it better able to secure<br>
supplies. Weismann points out that natural selection favours<br>
early and abundant reproduction. But whether the
qualifications<br>
of the "fittest" be strength, fertility, cunning, fleetness,<br>
imitation, or concealment, we are safe in concluding that
growth<br>
and reproduction must be the primary qualities which at once<br>
determine selection and are fostered by it. Inherent in the<br>
nature of the organism is accelerated absorption of energy,
but<br>
the qualifications of the "fittest" are various, for the
supply<br>
of energy is limited, and there are many competitors for it.
To<br>
secure that none be wasted is ultimately the object of
natural<br>
selection, deciding among the eager competitors what is best
for<br>
each.</p>
<p>In short, the facts and generalisations concerning evolution
must<br>
presuppose an organism endowed with the quality of
progressive<br>
absorption of energy, and retentive of it. The continuity of<br>
organic activity in a world where supplies are intermittent
is<br>
evidently only possible upon the latter condition. Thus it<br>
appears that the dynamic attitude of the organism, considered
in<br>
these pages, occupies a fundamental position regarding its<br>
evolution.</p>
<p>We turn to the consideration of old age and death,
endeavouring<br>
to discover in what relation they stand to the innate<br>
progressiveness of the organism.</p>
<p>81</p>
<p>THE PERIODICITY OF THE ORGANISM AND THE LAW OF PROGRESSIVE<br>
ACTIVITY</p>
<p>The organic system is essentially unstable. Its aggressive<br>
attitude is involved in the phenomenon of growth, and in<br>
reproduction which is a form of growth. But the energy
absorbed<br>
is not only spent in growth. It partly goes, also, to make
good<br>
the decay which arises from the instability of the organic
unit.<br>
The cell is molecularly perishable. It possesses its entity
much<br>
as a top keeps erect, by the continual inflow of energy.<br>
Metabolism is always taking place within it. Any other
condition<br>
would, probably, involve the difficulties of perpetual
motion.</p>
<p>The phenomenon of old age is not evident in the case of
the<br>
unicellular organism reproducing by fission. At any stage of
its<br>
history all the individuals are of the same age: all contain
a<br>
like portion of the original cell, so far as this can be
regarded<br>
as persisting where there is continual flux of matter and
energy.<br>
In the higher organisms death is universally evident. Why is<br>
this?</p>
<p>The question is one of great complexity. Considered from the
more<br>
fundamental molecular point of view we should perhaps look to<br>
failure of the power of cell division as the condition of<br>
mortality. For it is to this phenomenon&mdash;that of cell<br>
division&mdash;that the continued life of the protozoon is to
be<br>
ascribed, as we have already seen. Reproduction is, in fact,
the<br>
saving factor here.</p>
<p>As we do not know the source or nature of the stimulus</p>
<p>82</p>
<p>responsible for cell division we cannot give a molecular
account<br>
of death in the higher organisms. However we shall now see
that,<br>
philosophically, we are entitled to consider reproduction as
a<br>
saving factor in this case also; and to regard the death of
the<br>
individual much as we regard the fall of the leaf from the
tree:<br>
_i.e._ as the cessation of an outgrowth from a development<br>
extending from the past into the future. The phenomena of old
age<br>
and natural death are, in short, not at variance with the<br>
progressive activity of the organism. We perceive this when
we<br>
come to consider death from the evolutionary point of view.</p>
<p>Professor Weismann, in his two essays, "The Duration of
Life,"<br>
and "Life and Death,"[1] adopts and defends the view that
"death<br>
is not a primary necessity but that it has been secondarily<br>
acquired by adaptation." The cell was not inherently limited
in<br>
its number of cell-generations. The low unicellular organisms
are<br>
potentially immortal, the higher multicellular forms with<br>
well-differentiated organs contain the germs of death within<br>
themselves.</p>
<p>He finds the necessity of death in its utility to the
species.<br>
Long life is a useless luxury. Early and abundant reproduction
is<br>
best for the species. An immortal individual would gradually<br>
become injured and would be valueless or even harmful to the<br>
species by taking the place of those that are sound. Hence<br>
natural selection will shorten life.</p>
<p>[1] See his _Biological Memoirs._ Oxford, 1888.</p>
<p>83</p>
<p>Weismann contends against the transmission of acquired
characters<br>
as being unproved.[1] He bases the appearance of death on<br>
variations in the reproductive cells, encouraged by the
ceaseless<br>
action of natural selection, which led to a differentiation
into<br>
perishable somatic cells and immortal reproductive cells. The<br>
time-limit of any particular organism ultimately depends upon
the<br>
number of somatic cell-generations and the duration of each<br>
generation. These quantities are "predestined in the germ
itself"<br>
which gives rise to each individual. "The existence of
immortal<br>
metazoan organisms is conceivable," but their capacity for<br>
existence is influenced by conditions of the external world;
this<br>
renders necessary the process of adaptation. In fact, in the<br>
differentiation of somatic from reproductive cells, material
was<br>
provided upon which natural selection could operate to shorten
or<br>
to lengthen the life of the individual in accordance with the<br>
needs of the species. The soma is in a sense "a secondary<br>
appendage of the real bearer of life&mdash;the reproductive
cells." The<br>
somatic cells probably lost their immortal qualities, on this<br>
immortality becoming useless to the species. Their mortality
may<br>
have been a mere consequence of their differentiation (loc.
cit.,<br>
p. 140), itself due to natural selection. "Natural death was<br>
not," in fact, "introduced from absolute intrinsic necessity<br>
inherent in the nature of living matter, but on grounds of<br>
utility,</p>
<p>[1] Biological Memoirs, p. 142.</p>
<p>84</p>
<p>that is from necessities which sprang up, not from the
general<br>
conditions of life, but from those special conditions which<br>
dominate the life of multicellular organisms."</p>
<p>On the inherent immortality of life, Weismann finally
states:<br>
"Reproduction is, in truth, an essential attribute of living<br>
matter, just as the growth which gives rise to it.... Life is<br>
continuous, and not periodically interrupted: ever since its<br>
first appearance upon the Earth in the lowest organism, it
has<br>
continued without break; the forms in which it is manifest
have<br>
alone undergone change. Every individual alive today&mdash;even
the<br>
highest&mdash;is to be derived in an unbroken line from the first
and<br>
lowest forms." [1]</p>
<p>At the present day the view is very prevalent that the soma
of<br>
higher organisms is, in a sense, but the carrier for a period
of<br>
the immortal reproductive cells (Ray Lankester)[2]&mdash;an
appendage<br>
due to adaptation, concerned in their supply, protection, and<br>
transmission. And whether we regard the time-limit of its<br>
functions as due to external constraints, recurrently acting
till<br>
their effects become hereditary, or to variations more
directly<br>
of internal origin, encouraged by natural selection, we see
in<br>
old age and death phenomena ultimately brought about in
obedience<br>
to the action of an environment. These are not inherent in
the<br>
properties of living matter. But, in spite</p>
<p>[1] Loc. cit., p. 159</p>
<p>[2] Geddes and Thomson, The Evolution of Sex, chap. xviii.</p>
<p>85</p>
<p>of its mortality, the body remains a striking manifestation
of<br>
the progressiveness of the organism, for to this it must be<br>
ascribed. To it energy is available which is denied to the<br>
protozoon. Ingenious adaptations to environment are more<br>
especially its privilege. A higher manifestation, however,
was<br>
possible, and was found in the development of mind. This, too,
is<br>
a servant of the cell, as the genii of the lamp. Through it<br>
energy is available which is denied to the body. This is the<br>
masterpiece of the cell. Its activity dates, as it were, but
from<br>
yesterday, and today it inherits the most diverse energies of
the<br>
Earth.</p>
<p>Taking this view of organic succession, we may liken the<br>
individual to a particle vibrating for a moment and then
coming<br>
to rest, but sweeping out in its motion one wave in the<br>
continuous organic vibration travelling from the past into
the<br>
future. But as this vibration is one spreading with increased<br>
energy from each vibrating particle, its propagation involves
a<br>
continual accelerated inflow of energy from the surrounding<br>
medium, a dynamic condition unknown in periodic effects<br>
transmitted by inanimate actions, and, indeed, marking the<br>
fundamental difference between the dynamic attitudes of the<br>
animate and inanimate.</p>
<p>We can trace the periodic succession of individuals on a
diagram<br>
of activity with some advantage. Considering, first, the case
of<br>
the unicellular organism reproducing by subdivision and
recalling<br>
that conditions, definite and inevitable, oppose a limit to
the<br>
rate of growth, or, for our</p>
<p>86</p>
<p>present purpose, rate of consumption of energy, we proceed
as<br>
follows:</p>
<p>{Fig. 1}</p>
<p>Along a horizontal axis units of time are measured; along
a<br>
vertical axis units of energy. Then the life-history of the<br>
amoeba, for example, appears as a line such as A in Fig. 1.<br>
During the earlier stages of its growth the rate of absorption
of<br>
energy is small; so that in the unit interval of time, t, the<br>
small quantity of energy, e1, is absorbed. As life advances,
the<br>
activity of the organism augments, till finally this rate
attains<br>
a maximum, when e2 units of energy are consumed in the unit
of<br>
time.[1]</p>
<p>[1] Reference to p. 76, where the organic system is treated
as<br>
purely mechanical, may help readers to understand what is<br>
involved in this curve. The solar engine may, unquestionably,<br>
have its activity defined by such a curve. The organism is,<br>
indeed, more complex; but neither this fact nor our ignorance
of<br>
its mechanism, affects the principles which justify the
diagram.</p>
<p>87</p>
<p>On this diagram reproduction, on the part of the organism,
is<br>
represented by a line which repeats the curvature of the
parent<br>
organism originating at such a point as P in the path of the<br>
latter, when the rate of consumption of energy has become<br>
constant. The organism A has now ceased to act as a unit. The<br>
products of fission each carry on the vital development of</p>
<p>{Fig. 2}</p>
<p>the species along the curve B, which may be numbered (2),
to<br>
signify that it represents the activity of two individuals,
and<br>
so on, the numbering advancing in geometrical progression.
The<br>
particular curvature adopted in the diagram is, of course,<br>
imaginary; but it is not of an indeterminate nature. Its
course<br>
for any species is a characteristic of fundamental physical<br>
importance, regarding the part played in nature by the
particular<br>
organism.</p>
<p>88</p>
<p>In Fig. 2 is represented the path of a primitive
multicellular<br>
organism before the effects of competition produced or
fostered<br>
its mortality. The lettering of Fig. 1 applies; the
successive<br>
reproductive acts are marked P1, P2; Q1, Q2, etc., in the
paths<br>
of the successive individuals.</p>
<p>{Fig. 3}</p>
<p>The next figure (Fig. 3) diagrammatically illustrates death
in<br>
organic history. The path ever turns more and more from the
axis<br>
of energy, till at length the point is reached when no more<br>
energy is available; a tangent to the curve at this point is
at<br>
right angles to the axis of energy and parallel to the time
axis.<br>
The death point is reached, and however great a length we
measure<br>
along the axis of time, no further consumption of energy is</p>
<p>89</p>
<p>indicated by the path of the organism. Drawing the line
beyond<br>
the death point is meaningless for our present purpose.</p>
<p>It is observable that while the progress of animate nature
finds<br>
its representation on this diagram by lines sloping _upwards_
from<br>
left to right, the course of events in inanimate
nature&mdash;for<br>
example, the history of the organic configuration after death,
or</p>
<p>{Fig. 4}</p>
<p>the changes progressing&mdash;let us say, in the solar system,
or in<br>
the process of a crystallisation, would appear as lines
sloping<br>
downwards from left to right.</p>
<p>Whatever our views on the origin of death may be, we have
to<br>
recognise a periodicity of functions in the life-history of
the<br>
successive individuals of the present day; and whether or not
we<br>
trace this directly or indirectly to</p>
<p>90</p>
<p>a sort of interference with the rising wave of life, imposed
by<br>
the activity of a series of derived units, each seeking
energy,<br>
and in virtue of its adaptation each being more fitted to
obtain<br>
it than its predecessor, or even leave the idea of
interference<br>
out of account altogether in the origination or perpetuation
of<br>
death, the truth of the diagram (Fig. 4) holds in so far as
it<br>
may be supposed to graphically represent the dynamic history
of<br>
the individual. The point chosen on the curve for the
origination<br>
of a derived unit is only applicable to certain organisms,
many<br>
reproducing at the very close of life. A chain of units are<br>
supposed here represented.[1]</p>
<p>THE LENGTH OF LIFE</p>
<p>If we lay out waves as above to a common scale of time for<br>
different species, the difference of longevity is shown in
the<br>
greater or less number of vibrations executed in a given
time,<br>
_i.e._ in greater or less "frequency." We cannot indeed draw
the<br>
curvature correctly, for this would necessitate a knowledge
which<br>
we have not of the activity of the organism at different
periods<br>
of its life-history, and so neither can we plot the direction
of<br>
the organic line of propagation with respect to the</p>
<p>[1] Projecting upon the axes of time and energy any one
complete<br>
vibration, as in Fig. 4, the total energy consumed by the<br>
organism during life is the length E on the axis of energy,
and<br>
its period of life is the length T on the time-axis. The mean<br>
activity is the quotient E/T.</p>
<p>91</p>
<p>axes of reference as this involves a knowledge of the mean<br>
activity.[1]</p>
<p>The group of curves which follow, relating to typical
animals<br>
possessing very different activities (Fig. 5), are therefore<br>
entirely diagrammatic, except in respect to the approximate</p>
<p>{Fig. 5}</p>
<p>longevity of the organisms. (1) might represent an animal of
the<br>
length of life and of the activity of Man; (2), on the same
scale<br>
of longevity,</p>
<p>[1] In the relative food-supply at various periods of life
the<br>
curvature is approximately determinable.</p>
<p>92</p>
<p>one of the smaller mammals; and (3), the life-history of a
cold<br>
blooded animal living to a great age; _e.g._ certain of the<br>
reptilia.</p>
<p>It is probable, that to conditions of structural
development,<br>
under the influence of natural selection, the question of
longer<br>
or shorter life is in a great degree referable. Thus,
development<br>
along lines of large growth will tend to a slow rate of<br>
reproduction from the simple fact that unlimited energy to
supply<br>
abundant reproduction is not procurable, whatever we may
assume<br>
as to the strength or cunning exerted by the individual in
its<br>
efforts to obtain its supplies. On the other hand,
development<br>
along lines of small growth, in that reproduction is less
costly,<br>
will probably lead to increased rate of reproduction. It is,
in<br>
fact, matter of general observation that in the case of
larger<br>
animals the rate of reproduction is generally slower than in
the<br>
case of smaller animals. But the rate of reproduction might
be<br>
expected to have an important influence in determining the<br>
particular periodicity of the organism. Were we to depict in
the<br>
last diagram, on the same time-scale as Man, the vibrations
of<br>
the smaller and shorter-lived living things, we would see but
a<br>
straight line, save for secular variations in activity,<br>
representing the progress of the species in time: the tiny<br>
thrills of its units lost in comparison with the yet brief
period<br>
of Man.</p>
<p>The interdependence of the rate of reproduction and</p>
<p>93</p>
<p>the duration of the individual is, indeed, very probably
revealed<br>
in the fact that short-lived animals most generally reproduce<br>
themselves rapidly and in great abundance, and vice versa. In<br>
many cases where this appears contradicted, it will be found
that<br>
the young are exposed to such dangers that but few survive
(_e.g._<br>
many of the reptilia, etc.), and so the rate of reproduction
is<br>
actually slow.</p>
<p>Death through the periodic rigour of the inanimate
environment<br>
calls forth phenomena very different from death introduced or<br>
favoured by competition. A multiplicity of effects simulative
of<br>
death occur. Organisms will, for example, learn to meet very<br>
rigorous conditions if slowly introduced, and not permanent.
A<br>
transitory period of want can be tided over by contrivance.
The<br>
lily withdrawing its vital forces into the bulb, protected
from<br>
the greatest extremity of rigour by seclusion in the Earth;
the<br>
trance of the hibernating animal; are instances of such<br>
contrivances.</p>
<p>But there are organisms whose life-wave truly takes up the<br>
periodicity of the Earth in its orbit. Thus the smaller
animals<br>
and plants, possessing less resources in themselves, die at
the<br>
approach of winter, propagating themselves by units which,<br>
whether egg or seed, undergo a period of quiescence during
the<br>
season of want. In these quiescent units the energy of the<br>
organism is potential, and the time-energy function is in<br>
abeyance. This condition is, perhaps, foreshadowed in the<br>
encyst-</p>
<p>94</p>
<p>ment of the amoeba in resistance to drought. In most cases
of<br>
hibernation the time-energy function seems maintained at a
loss<br>
of potential by the organism, a diminished vital consumption
of<br>
energy being carried on at the expense of the stored energy
of<br>
the tissues. So, too, even among the largest organisms there
will<br>
be a diminution of activity periodically inspired by<br>
climatological conditions. Thus, wholly or in part, the
activity<br>
of organisms is recurrently affected by the great
energy&mdash;tides<br>
set up by the Earth's orbital motion.</p>
<p>{Fig. 6}</p>
<p>Similarly in the phenomenon of sleep the organism responds to
the<br>
Earth's axial periodicity, for in the interval of night a
period<br>
of impoverishment has to be endured. Thus the diurnal waves
of<br>
energy also meet a response in the organism. These tides and<br>
waves of activity would appear as larger and smaller ripples</p>
<p>95</p>
<p>on the life-curve of the organism. But in some, in which life
and<br>
death are encompassed in a day, this would not be so; and for
the<br>
annual among plants, the seed rest divides the waves with
lines<br>
of no activity (Fig. 6).</p>
<p>Thus, finally, we regard the organism as a dynamic
phenomenon<br>
passing through periodic variations of intensity. The
material<br>
systems concerned in the transfer of the energy rise,
flourish,<br>
and fall in endless succession, like cities of ancient
dynasties.<br>
At points of similar phase upon the waves the rate of
consumption<br>
of energy is approximately the same; the functions, too,
which<br>
demand and expend the energy are of similar nature.</p>
<p>That the rhythm of these events is ultimately based on harmony
in<br>
the configuration and motion of the molecules within the germ<br>
seems an unavoidable conclusion. In the life of the
individual<br>
rhythmic dynamic phenomena reappear which in some cases have
no<br>
longer a parallel in the external world, or under conditions
when<br>
the individual is no longer influenced by these external<br>
conditions.,, In many cases the periodic phenomena ultimately
die<br>
out under new influences, like the oscillations of a body in
a<br>
viscous medium; in others when they seem to be more deeply
rooted<br>
in physiological conditions they persist.</p>
<p>The "length of life is dependent upon the number</p>
<p>[1] The _Descent of Man._</p>
<p>96</p>
<p>of generations of somatic cells which can succeed one another
in<br>
the course of a single life, and furthermore the number as
well<br>
as the duration of each single cell-generation is predestined
in<br>
the germ itself."[1]</p>
<p>Only in the vague conception of a harmonising or formative<br>
structural influence derived from the germ, perishing in each<br>
cell from internal causes, but handed from cell to cell till
the<br>
formative influence itself degrades into molecular discords,
does<br>
it seem possible to form any physical representation of the<br>
successive events of life. The degradation of the molecular<br>
formative influence might be supposed involved in its
frequent<br>
transference according to some such dynamic actions as occur
in<br>
inanimate nature. Thus, ultimately, to the waste within the
cell,<br>
to the presence of a force retardative of its perpetual
harmonic<br>
motions, the death of the individual is to be ascribed.
Perhaps<br>
in protoplasmic waste the existence of a universal death
should<br>
be recognised. It is here we seem to touch inanimate nature;
and<br>
we are led back to a former conclusion that the organism in
its<br>
unconstrained state is to be regarded as a contrivance for<br>
evading the dynamic tendencies of actions in which lifeless<br>
matter participates.[2]</p>
<p>[1] Weismann, _Life and Death; Biological Memoirs_, p.
146.</p>
<p>[2] In connection with the predestinating power and
possible<br>
complexity of the germ, it is instructive to reflect on the
very<br>
great molecular population of even the smallest
spores&mdash;giving<br>
rise to very simple forms. Thus, the spores of the
unicellular<br>
Schizomycetes are estimated to dimensions as low as 1/10,000 of
a<br>
millimetre in diameter (Cornil et Babes, _Les Batteries_, 1.
37).<br>
From Lord Kelvin's estimate of the number of molecules in
water,<br>
comprised within the length of a wave-length of yellow light<br>
(_The Size of Atoms_, Proc. R. I., vol. x., p. 185) it is<br>
probable that such spores contain some 500,000 molecules,
while<br>
one hundred molecules range along a diameter.</p>
<p>97</p>
<p>THE NUMERICAL ABUNDANCE OF LIFE</p>
<p>We began by seeking in various manifestations of life a
dynamic<br>
principle sufficiently comprehensive to embrace its very
various<br>
phenomena. This, to all appearance, found, we have been led
to<br>
regard life, to a great extent, as a periodic dynamic
phenomenon.<br>
Fundamentally, in that characteristic of the contrivance,
which<br>
leads it to respond favourably to transfer of energy, its<br>
enormous extension is due. It is probable that to its
instability<br>
its numerical abundance is to be traced&mdash;for this,
necessitating<br>
the continual supply of all the parts already formed, renders<br>
large, undifferentiated growth, incompatible with the limited<br>
supplies of the environment. These are fundamental conditions
of<br>
abundant life upon the Earth.</p>
<p>Although we recognise in the instability of living systems
the<br>
underlying reason for their numerical abundance, secondary<br>
evolutionary causes are at work. The most important of these
is<br>
the self-favouring nature of the phenomenon of reproduction.
Thus<br>
there is a tendency not only to favour reproductiveness, but<br>
early reproductiveness, in the form of one prolific<br>
reproductive.</p>
<p>98</p>
<p>act, after which the individual dies.[1] Hence the wavelength
of<br>
the species diminishes, reproduction is more frequent, and<br>
correspondingly greater numbers come and go in an interval of<br>
time.</p>
<p>Another cause of the numerical abundance of life exists,
as<br>
already stated, in the conditions of nourishment. Energy is
more<br>
readily conveyed to the various parts of the smaller mass,
and<br>
hence the lesser organisms will more actively functionate;
and<br>
this, as being the urging dynamic attitude, as well as that
most<br>
generally favourable in the struggle, will multiply and
favour<br>
such forms of life. On the other hand, however, these forms
will<br>
have less resource within themselves, and less power of<br>
endurance, so that they are only suitable to fairly uniform<br>
conditions of supply; they cannot survive the long continued
want<br>
of winter, and so we have the seasonal abundance of summer.
Only<br>
the larger and more resistant organisms, whether animal or<br>
vegetable, will, in general, populate the Earth from year to<br>
year. From this we may conclude that, but for the seasonal<br>
energy-tides, the development of life upon the globe had gone<br>
along very different lines from those actually followed. It
is,<br>
indeed, possible that the evolution of the larger organisms
would<br>
not have occurred; there would have been no vacant place for<br>
their development, and a being so endowed as Man could hardly</p>
<p>[1] Weismann, _The Duration of Life._</p>
<p>99</p>
<p>have been evolved. We may, too, apply this reasoning
elsewhere,<br>
and regard as highly probable, that in worlds which are
without<br>
seasonal influences, the higher developments of life have not<br>
appeared; except they have been evolved under other
conditions,<br>
when they might for a period persist. We have, indeed, only
to<br>
picture to ourselves what the consequence of a continuance of<br>
summer would be on insect life to arrive at an idea of the<br>
antagonistic influences obtaining in such worlds to the
survival<br>
of larger organisms.</p>
<p>It appears that to the dynamic attitude of life in the
first<br>
place, and secondarily to the environmental conditions
limiting<br>
undifferentiated growth, as well as to the action of heredity
in<br>
transmitting the reproductive qualities of the parent to the<br>
offspring, the multitudes of the pines, and the hosts of
ants,<br>
are to be ascribed. Other causes are very certainly at work,
but<br>
these, I think, must remain primary causes.</p>
<p>We well know that the abundance of the ants and pines is not
a<br>
tithe of the abundance around us visible and invisible. It is
a<br>
vain endeavour to realise the countless numbers of our<br>
fellow-citizens upon the Earth; but, for our purpose, the<br>
restless ants, and the pines solemnly quiet in the sunshine,
have<br>
served as types of animate things. In the pine the gates of
the<br>
organic have been thrown open that the vivifying river of
energy<br>
may flow in. The ants and the butterflies sip for a brief
moment<br>
of its waters, and again vanish into the</p>
<p>100</p>
<p>inorganic: life, love and death encompassed in a day.</p>
<p>Whether the organism stands at rest and life comes to it on
the<br>
material currents of the winds and waters, or in the
vibratory<br>
energy of the &aelig;ther; or, again, whether with restless
craving it<br>
hurries hither and thither in search of it, matters nothing.
The<br>
one principle&mdash;the accelerative law which is the law of
the<br>
organic&mdash;urges all alike onward to development, reproduction
and<br>
death. But although the individual dies death is not the end;
for<br>
life is a rhythmic phenomenon. Through the passing ages the
waves<br>
of life persist: waves which change in their form and in the<br>
frequency to which they are attuned from one geologic period
to<br>
the next, but which still ever persist and still ever
increase.<br>
And in the end the organism outlasts the generations of the<br>
hills.</p>
<p>101</p>
<p><u>THE BRIGHT COLOURS OF ALPINE FLOWERS</u> [1]</p>
<p>IT is admitted by all observers that many species of
flowering<br>
plants growing on the higher alps of mountainous regions
display<br>
a more vivid and richer colour in their bloom than is
displayed<br>
in the same species growing in the valleys. That this is
actually<br>
the case, and not merely an effect produced upon the observer
by<br>
the scant foliage rendering the bloom more conspicuous, has
been<br>
shown by comparative microscopic examination of the petals of<br>
species growing on the heights and in the valleys. Such<br>
examination has revealed that in many cases pigment granules
are<br>
more numerous in the individuals growing at the higher
altitudes.<br>
The difference is specially marked in Myosotis sylvatica,<br>
Campanula rotundifolia, Ranunculus sylvaticus, Galium
cruciatum,<br>
and others. It is less marked in the case of Thymus serpyllum
and<br>
Geranium sylvaticum; while in Rosa alpina and Erigeron alpinus
no<br>
difference is observable.[2]</p>
<p>In the following cases a difference of intensity of colour
is,<br>
according to Kerner ("Pflanzenleben," 11. 504), especially<br>
noticeable:&mdash; _Agrostemma githago, Campanula</p>
<p>[1] _Proc. Royal Dublin Society_, 1893.</p>
<p>[2] G. Bonnier, quoted by De Varigny, _Experimental
Evolution_,<br>
p. 55.</p>
<p>102</p>
<p>pusilla, Dianthus inodorus (silvestris), Gypsophila repens,
Lotus<br>
corniculatus, Saponaria ocymoides, Satureja hortensis,
Taraxacumm<br>
officinale, Vicia cracca, and Vicia sepium._</p>
<p>To my own observation this beautiful phenomenon has always<br>
appeared most obvious and impressive. It appears to have
struck<br>
many unprofessional observers. Helmholtz offers the
explanation<br>
that the vivid colours are the result of the brighter sunlight
of<br>
the heights. It has been said, too, that they are the direct<br>
chemical effects of a more highly ozonized atmosphere. The
latter<br>
explanation I am unable to refer to its author. The following<br>
pages contain a suggestion on the matter, which occurred to
me<br>
while touring, along with Henry H. Dixon, in the Linthal
district<br>
of Switzerland last summer.[1]</p>
<p>If the bloom of these higher alpine flowers is especially<br>
pleasing to our own &aelig;sthetic instincts, and markedly
conspicuous<br>
to us as observers, why not also especially attractive and<br>
conspicuous to the insect whose mission it is to wander from<br>
flower to flower over the pastures? The answer to this
question<br>
involves the hypothesis I would advance as accounting for the<br>
bright colours of high-growing individuals. In short, I believe
a<br>
satisfactory explanation is to be found in the conditions of<br>
insect life in the higher alps.</p>
<p>In the higher pastures the summer begins late and</p>
<p>[1] The summer of 1892.</p>
<p>103</p>
<p>closes early, and even in the middle of summer the day closes
in<br>
with extreme cold, and the cold of night is only dispelled
when<br>
the sun is well up. Again, clouds cover the heights when all
is<br>
clear below, and cold winds sweep over them when there is
warmth<br>
and shelter in the valleys. With these rigorous conditions
the<br>
pollinating insects have to contend in their search for food,
and<br>
that when the rival attractions of the valleys below are so
many.<br>
I believe it is these rigorous conditions which are
indirectly<br>
responsible for the bright colours of alpine flowers. For
such<br>
conditions will bring about a comparative scarcity of insect<br>
activity on the heights; and a scarcity or uncertainty in the<br>
action of insect agency in effecting fertilization will
intensify<br>
the competition to attract attention, and only the brightest<br>
blooms will be fertilized.[1]</p>
<p>This will be a natural selection of the brightest, or the</p>
<p>[1] Grant Allen, I have recently learned, advances in _Science
in<br>
Arcady_ the theory that there is a natural selective cause<br>
fostering the bright blooms of alpines. The selective cause
is,<br>
however, by him referred to the greater abundance of
butterfly<br>
relatively to bee fertilizers. The former, he says, display
more<br>
&aelig;sthetic instinct than bees. In the valley the bees secure
the<br>
fertilization of all. I may observe that upon the Fridolins
Alp<br>
all the fertilizers we observed were bees. I have always
found<br>
butterflies very scarce at altitudes of 7,000 to 8,000 feet.
The<br>
alpine bees are very light in body, like our hive bee, and I
do<br>
not think rarefaction of the atmosphere can operate to hinder
its<br>
ascent to the heights, as Grant Allen suggests. The
observations<br>
on the death-rate of bees and butterflies on the glacier, to
be<br>
referred to presently, seem to negative such a hypothesis, and
to<br>
show that a large preponderance of bees over butterflies make<br>
their way to the heights.</p>
<p>104</p>
<p>brightest will be the fittest, and this condition, along with
the<br>
influence of heredity, will encourage a race of vivid flowers.
On<br>
the other hand, the more scant and uncertain root supply, and
the<br>
severe atmospheric conditions, will not encourage the grosser<br>
struggle for existence which in the valleys is carried on so<br>
eagerly between leaves and branches&mdash;the normal offensive
and<br>
defensive weapons of the plant&mdash;and so the struggle
becomes<br>
refined into the more &aelig;sthetic one of colour and
brightness<br>
between flower and flower. Hence the scant foliage and vivid<br>
bloom would be at once the result of a necessary economy, and
a<br>
resort to the best method of securing reproduction under the<br>
circumstances of insect fertilizing agency. Or, in other
words,<br>
while the luxuriant growth is forbidden by the conditions,
and<br>
thus methods of offence and defence, based upon vigorous<br>
development, reduced in importance, it would appear that the<br>
struggle is mainly referred to rivalry for insect preference.
It<br>
is probable that this is the more economical manner of
carrying<br>
on the contest.</p>
<p>In the valleys we see on every side the struggle between
the<br>
vegetative organs of the plant; the soundless battle among
the<br>
leaves and branches. The blossom here is carried aloft on a<br>
slender stem, or else, taking but a secondary part in the<br>
contest, it is relegated to obscurity (P1. XII.). Further up
on<br>
the mountains, where the conditions are more severe and the<br>
supplies less abundant, the leaf and branch assume lesser<br>
dimensions, for they are costly weapons to provide and the<br>
elements are unfriendly</p>
<p>105</p>
<p>to their existence (Pl. XIII.). Still higher, approaching
the<br>
climatic limit of vegetable life, the struggle for existence
is<br>
mainly carried on by the &aelig;sthetic rivalry of lowly but<br>
conspicuous blossoms.</p>
<p>As regards the conditions of insect life in the higher alps,
it<br>
came to my notice in a very striking manner that vast numbers
of<br>
such bees and butterflies as venture up perish in the cold of<br>
night time. It appears as if at the approach of dusk these
are<br>
attracted by the gleam of the snow, and quitting the
pastures,<br>
lose themselves upon the glaciers and firns, there to die in<br>
hundreds. Thus in an ascent of the T&ouml;di from the
Fridolinsh&uuml;te we<br>
counted in the early dawn sixty-seven frozen bees,
twenty-nine<br>
dead butterflies, and some half-dozen moths on the Biferten<br>
Glacier and Firn. These numbers, it is to be remembered, only<br>
included those lying to either side of our way over the snow,
so<br>
that the number must have mounted up to thousands when
integrated<br>
over the entire glacier and firn. Approaching the summit none<br>
were found. The bees resembled our hive bee in appearance,
the<br>
butterflies resembled the small white variety common in our<br>
gardens, which has yellow and black upon its wings. One large<br>
moth, striped across the abdomen, and measuring nearly two
inches<br>
in length of body, was found. Upon our return, long after the<br>
sun's rays had grown strong, we observed some of the
butterflies<br>
showed signs of reanimation. We descended so quickly to avoid
the<br>
inconvenience of the soft snow that we had time for no</p>
<p>106</p>
<p>close observation on the frozen bees. But dead bees are
common<br>
objects upon the snows of the alps.</p>
<p>These remarks I noted down roughly while at Linthal last
summer,<br>
but quite recently I read in Natural Science[1] the following<br>
note:</p>
<p>"Late Flowering Plants.&mdash;While we write, the ivy is in
flower, and<br>
bees, wasps, and flies are jostling each other and struggling
to<br>
find standing-room on the sweet-smelling plant. How great must
be<br>
the advantage obtained by this plant through its exceptional<br>
habit of flowering in the late autumn, and ripening its fruit
in<br>
the spring. To anyone who has watched the struggle to
approach<br>
the ivy-blossom at a time when nearly all other plants are
bare,<br>
it is evident that, as far as transport of pollen and<br>
cross-fertilization go, the plant could not flower at a more<br>
suitable time. The season is so late that most other plants
are<br>
out of flower, but yet it is not too late for many insects to
be<br>
brought out by each sunny day, and each insect, judging by
its<br>
behaviour, must be exceptionally hungry.</p>
<p>"Not only has the ivy the world to itself during its
flowering<br>
season, but it delays to ripen its seed till the spring, a
time<br>
when most other plants have shed their seed, and most edible<br>
fruits have been picked by the birds. Thus birds wanting fruit
in<br>
the spring can obtain little but ivy, and how they appreciate
the<br>
ivy berry is evident</p>
<p>[1] For December, 1892, vol. i., p. 730.</p>
<p>107</p>
<p>by the purple stains everywhere visible within a short
distance<br>
of the bush."</p>
<p>These remarks suggest that the ivy adopts the converse
attitude<br>
towards its visitors to that forced upon the alpine flower.
The<br>
ivy bloom is small and inconspicuous, but then it has the
season<br>
to itself, and its inconspicuousness is no disadvantage,
_i.e._<br>
if one plant was more conspicuous than its neighbours, it
would<br>
not have any decided advantage where the pollinating insect
is<br>
abundant and otherwise unprovided for. Its dark-green berries
in<br>
spring, which I would describe as very inconspicuous, have a<br>
similar advantage in relation to the necessities of bird
life.</p>
<p>The experiments of M. C. Flahault must be noticed. This<br>
naturalist grew seeds of coloured flowers which had ripened
in<br>
Paris, part in Upsala, and part in Paris; and seed which had<br>
ripened in Upsala, part at Paris, and part at Upsala. The
flowers<br>
opening in the more northern city were in most cases the<br>
brighter.[1] If this observation may be considered
indisputable,<br>
as appears to be the case, the question arises, Are we to
regard<br>
this as a direct effect of the more rigorous climate upon the<br>
development of colouring matter on the blooms opening at
Upsala?<br>
If we suppose an affirmative answer, the theory of direct
effect<br>
by sun brightness must I think be abandoned. But I venture to<br>
think that the explanation of the Upsala</p>
<p>[1] Quoted by De Varigny, _Experimental Evolution_, p. 56.</p>
<p>108</p>
<p>experiment is not to be found in direct climatic influence
upon<br>
the colour, but in causes which lie deeper, and involve some<br>
factors deducible from biological theory.</p>
<p>The organism, as a result of the great facts of heredity and
of<br>
the survival of the fittest, is necessarily a system which<br>
gathers experience with successive generations; and the
principal<br>
lesson ever being impressed upon it by external events is<br>
economy. Its success depends upon the use it makes of its<br>
opportunities for the reception of energy and the economy<br>
attained in disposing of what is gained.</p>
<p>With regard to using the passing opportunity the entire
seasonal<br>
development of life is a manifestation of this attitude, and
the<br>
fleetness, agility, etc., of higher organisms are developments
in<br>
this direction. The higher vegetable organism is not
locomotory,<br>
save in the transferences of pollen and seed, for its food
comes<br>
to it, and the necessary relative motion between food and<br>
organism is preserved in the quick motion of radiated energy
from<br>
the sun and the slower motion of the winds on the surface of
the<br>
earth. But, even so, the vegetable organism must stand ever
ready<br>
and waiting for its supplies. Its molecular parts must be
ready<br>
to seize the prey offered to it, somewhat as the waiting
spider<br>
the fly. Hence, the plant stands ready; and every cloud with<br>
moving shadow crossing the fields handicaps the shaded to the<br>
benefit of the unshaded plant in the adjoining field. The
open<br>
bloom</p>
<p>109</p>
<p>is a manifestation of the generally expectant attitude of
the<br>
plant, but in relation to reproduction.</p>
<p>As regards economy, any principle of maximum economy, where
many<br>
functions have to be fulfilled, will, we may very safely
predict,<br>
involve as far as possible mutual helpfulness in the
processes<br>
going on. Thus the process of the development towards meeting
any<br>
particular external conditions, A, suppose, will, if
possible,<br>
tend to forward the development towards meeting conditions B;
so<br>
that, in short, where circumstances of morphology and
physiology<br>
are favourable, the ideally economical system will be
attained<br>
when in place of two separate processes, a, &szlig;, the one
process y,<br>
cheaper than a + &szlig;, suffices to advance development<br>
simultaneously in both the directions A and B. The economy is
as<br>
obvious as that involved in "killing two birds with the one<br>
stone"&mdash;if so crude a simile is permissible&mdash;and it is
to be<br>
expected that to foster such economy will be the tendency of<br>
evolution in all organic systems subjected to restraints as
those<br>
we are acquainted with invariably are.</p>
<p>Such economy might be simply illustrated by considering the
case<br>
of a reservoir of water elevated above two hydraulic motors,
so<br>
that the elevated mass of water possessed gravitational<br>
potential. The available energy here represents the stored-up<br>
energy in the organism. How best may the water be conveyed to
the<br>
two motors [the organic systems reacting towards conditions A
and<br>
B] so</p>
<p>110</p>
<p>that as little energy as possible is lost in transit? If
the<br>
motors are near together it is most economical to use the one<br>
conduit, which will distribute the requisite supply of water
to<br>
both. If the motors are located far asunder it will be most<br>
economical to lay separate conduits. There is greatest economy
in<br>
meeting a plurality of functions by the same train of<br>
physiological processes where this is consistent with meeting<br>
other demands necessitated by external or internal
conditions.</p>
<p>But an important and obvious consequence arises in the supply
of<br>
the two motors from the one conduit. We cannot work one motor<br>
without working the other. If we open a valve in the conduit
both<br>
motors start into motion and begin consuming the energy stored
in<br>
the tank. And although they may both under one set of
conditions<br>
be doing useful and necessary work, in some other set of<br>
conditions it may be needless for both to be driven.</p>
<p>This last fact is an illustration of a consideration which
must<br>
enter into the phenomenon which an eminent biologist speaks of
as<br>
physiological or unconscious "memory,"[1] For the development
of<br>
the organism from the ovum is but the starting of a train of<br>
interdependent events of a complexity depending upon the<br>
experience of the past.</p>
<p>[1] Ewald Hering, quoted by Ray Lankaster, _The Advancement
of<br>
Science_, p. 283.</p>
<p>111</p>
<p>In short, we may suppose the entire development of the
plant,<br>
towards meeting certain groups of external conditions,<br>
physiologically knit together according as Nature tends to<br>
associate certain groups of conditions. Thus, in the case in<br>
point, climatic rigour and scarcity of pollinating agency
will<br>
ever be associated; and in the long experience of the past
the<br>
most economical physiological attitude towards both is, we
may<br>
suppose, adopted; so that the presence of one condition
excites<br>
the apparent unconscious memory of the other. In reality the<br>
process of meeting the one condition involves the process and<br>
development for meeting the other.</p>
<p>And this consideration may be extended very generally to
such<br>
organisms as can survive under the same associated natural<br>
conditions, for the history of evolution is so long, and the<br>
power of locomotion so essential to the organism at some
period<br>
in its life history, that we cannot philosophically assume a<br>
local history for members of a species even if widely severed<br>
geographically at the present day. At some period in the past<br>
then, it is very possible that the individuals today thriving
at<br>
Paris, acquired the experience called out at Upsala. The<br>
perfection of physiological memory inspires no limit to the
date<br>
at which this may have occurred&mdash;possibly the result of
a<br>
succession of severe seasons at Paris; possibly the result of<br>
migrations &mdash;and the seed of many flowering plants possess
means<br>
of migration only inferior to those possessed by the flying
and<br>
swimming animals. But, again, possibly the experi-</p>
<p>112</p>
<p>ence was acquired far back in the evolutionary history of
the<br>
flower.[1]</p>
<p>But a further consideration arises. Not only at each moment
in<br>
the life of the individual must maximum income and most
judicious<br>
expenditure be considered, but in its whole life history, and<br>
even over the history of its race, the efficiency must tend to
be<br>
a maximum. This principle is even carried so far that when<br>
necessary it leads to the death of the individual, as in the
case<br>
of those organisms which, having accomplished the
reproductive<br>
act, almost immediately expire. This view of nature may be<br>
repellent, but it is, nevertheless, evident that we are parts
of<br>
a system which ruthlessly sacrifices the individual on
general<br>
grounds of economy. Thus, if the curve which defines the mean<br>
rate of reception of energy of all kinds at different periods
in<br>
the life of the organism be opposed by a second curve, drawn<br>
below the axis along which time is measured, representing the<br>
mean rate of expenditure of energy on development,
reproduction,<br>
etc. (Fig. 7), this latter curve, which is, of course,</p>
<p>[1] The blooms of self-fertilising, and especially of<br>
cleistogamic plants (_e.g._ Viola), are examples of
unconscious<br>
memory, or unconscious "association of ideas" leading to the<br>
development of organs now functionless. The _Pontederia
crassipes_<br>
of the Amazon, which develops its floating bladders when grown
in<br>
water, but aborts them rapidly when grown on land, and seems
to<br>
retain this power of adaptation to the environment for an<br>
indefinite period of time, must act in each case upon an<br>
unconscious memory based upon past experience. Many other
cases<br>
might be cited.</p>
<p>113</p>
<p>physiologically dependent on the former, must be of such a
nature<br>
from its origin to its completion in death, that the condition
is<br>
realized of the most economical rate of expenditure at each<br>
period of life.[1] The rate of expenditure of energy at any<br>
period of life is, of course, in such a curve defined by the<br>
slope of the curve towards the axis of time at the period in<br>
question; but this particular slope _must be led to by a
previous<br>
part of the curve, and involves its past and future course to
a<br>
very great extent_.</p>
<p>{Fig. 7}</p>
<p>There will, therefore, be impressed upon the<br>
organism by the factors of evolution a unified course of<br>
economical expenditure completed only by its death, and which<br>
will give to the developmental progress of the individual its<br>
prophetic character.</p>
<p>In this way we look to the unified career of each organic
unit,<br>
from its commencement in the ovum to the day</p>
<p>[1] See _The Abundance of Life_.</p>
<p>114</p>
<p>when it is done with vitality, for that preparation for
momentous<br>
organic events which is in progress throughout the entire
course<br>
of development; and to the economy involved in the welding of<br>
physiological processes for the phenomenon of physiological<br>
memory, wherein we see reflected, as it were, in the
development<br>
of the organism, the association of inorganic restraints<br>
occurring in nature which at some previous period impressed<br>
itself upon the plastic organism. We may picture the seedling
at<br>
Upsala, swayed by organic memory and the inherited tendency to
an<br>
economical preparation for future events, gradually
developing<br>
towards the &aelig;sthetic climax of its career. In some such
manner<br>
only does it appear possible to account for the prophetic<br>
development of organisms, not alone to be observed in the
alpine<br>
flowers, but throughout nature.</p>
<p>And thus, finally, to the effects of natural selection and
to<br>
actions defined by general principles involved in biology, I<br>
would refer for explanation of the manner in which flowers on
the<br>
Alps develop their peculiar beauty.</p>
<p>115</p>
<p><u>MOUNTAIN GENESIS</u></p>
<p>OUR ancestors regarded mountainous regions with feelings
of<br>
horror, mingled with commiseration for those whom an unkindly<br>
destiny had condemned to dwell therein. We, on the other
hand,<br>
find in the contemplation of the great alps of the Earth such<br>
peaceful and elevated thoughts, and such rest to our souls,
that<br>
it is to those very solitudes we turn to heal the wounds of
ife.<br>
It is difficult to explain the cause of this very different
point<br>
of view. It is probably, in part, to be referred to that cloud
of<br>
superstitious horror which, throughout the Middle Ages,
peopled<br>
the solitudes with unknown terrors; and, in part, to the<br>
asceticism which led the pious to regard the beauty and joy
of<br>
life as snares to the soul's well-being. In those eternal<br>
solitudes where the overwhelming forces of Nature are most in<br>
evidence, an evil principle must dwell or a dragon's dreadful<br>
brood must find a home.</p>
<p>But while in our time the aesthetic aspect of the hills
appeals<br>
to all, there remains in the physical history of the
mountains<br>
much that is lost to those who have not shared in the
scientific<br>
studies of alpine structure and genesis. They lose a past
history<br>
which for interest com-</p>
<p>116</p>
<p>petes with anything science has to tell of the changes of
the<br>
Earth.</p>
<p>Great as are the physical features of the mountains compared
with<br>
the works of Man, and great as are the forces involved
compared<br>
with those we can originate or control, the loftiest ranges
are<br>
small contrasted with the dimensions of the Earth. It is well
to<br>
bear this in mind. I give here (Pl. XV.) a measured drawing<br>
showing a sector cut from a sphere of 50 cms. radius; so much
of<br>
it as to exhibit the convergence of its radial boundaries
which<br>
if prolonged will meet at the centre. On the same scale as
the<br>
radius the diagram shows the highest mountains and the
deepest<br>
ocean. The average height of the land and the average depth
of<br>
the ocean are also exhibited. We see how small a movement of
the<br>
crust the loftiest elevation of the Himalaya represents and
what<br>
a little depression holds the ocean.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, it is not by any means easy to explain the
genesis<br>
of those small elevations and depressions. It would lead us
far<br>
from our immediate subject to discuss the various theoretical<br>
views which have been advanced to account for the facts. The
idea<br>
that mountain folds, and the lesser rugosities of the Earth's<br>
surface, arose in a wrinkling of the crust under the influence
of<br>
cooling and skrinkage of the subcrustal materials, is held by<br>
many eminent geologists, but not without dissent from others.</p>
<p>The most striking observational fact connected with
mountain<br>
structure is that, without exception, the ranges</p>
<p>117</p>
<p>of the Earth are built essentially of sedimentary rocks: that
is<br>
of rocks which have been accumulated at some remote past time<br>
beneath the surface of the ocean. A volcanic core there may<br>
sometimes be&mdash;probably an attendant or consequence of
the<br>
uplifting&mdash;or a core of plutonic igneous rocks which has
arisen<br>
under the same compressive forces which have bowed and arched
the<br>
strata from their original horizontal position. It is not<br>
uncommon to meet among unobservant people those who regard
all<br>
mountain ranges as volcanic in origin. Volcanoes, however, do
not<br>
build mountain ranges. They break out as more or less
isolated<br>
cones or hills. Compare the map of the Auvergne with that of<br>
Switzerland; the volcanoes of South Italy with the Apennines.<br>
Such great ranges as those which border with triple walls the<br>
west coast of North America are in no sense volcanic: nor are
the<br>
Pyrenees, the Caucasus, or the Himalaya. Volcanic materials
are<br>
poured out from the summits of the Andes, but the range itself
is<br>
built up of folded sediments on the same architecture as the<br>
other great ranges of the Earth.</p>
<p>Before attempting an explanation of the origin of the
mountains<br>
we must first become more closely acquainted with the
phenomena<br>
attending mountain elevation.</p>
<p>At the present day great accumulations of sediment are
taking<br>
place along the margins of the continents where the rivers
reach<br>
the ocean. Thus, the Gulf of Mexico receiving the sediment of
the<br>
Mississippi and Rio Grande;</p>
<p>118</p>
<p>the northeast coast of South America receiving the sediments
of<br>
the Amazons; the east coast of Asia receiving the detritus of
the<br>
Chinese rivers; are instances of such areas of deposition.
Year<br>
by year, century by century, the accumulation progresses, and
as<br>
it grows the floor of the sea sinks under the load. Of the<br>
yielding of the crust under the burthen of the sediments we
are<br>
assured; for otherwise the many miles of vertically piled
strata<br>
which are uplifted to our view in the mountains, never could
have<br>
been deposited in the coastal seas of the past. The flexure
and<br>
sinking of the crust are undeniable realities.</p>
<p>Such vast subsiding areas are known as geosynclines. From
the<br>
accumulated sediments of the geosynclines the mountain ranges
of<br>
the past have in every case originated; and the mountains of
the<br>
future will assuredly arise and lofty ranges will stand where
now<br>
the ocean waters close over the collecting sediments. Every<br>
mountain range upon the Earth enforces the certainty of this<br>
prediction.</p>
<p>The mountain-forming movement takes place after a certain
great<br>
depth of sediment is collected. It is most intense where the<br>
thickness of deposit is greatest. We see this when we examine
the<br>
structure of our existing mountain ranges. At either side
where<br>
the sediments thin out, the disturbance dies away, till we
find<br>
the comparatively shallow and undisturbed level sediments
which<br>
clothe the continental surface.</p>
<p>Whatever be the connection between the deposition and</p>
<p>119</p>
<p>the subsequent upheaval, _the element of great depth of<br>
accumulation seems a necessary condition and must evidently
enter<br>
as a factor into the Physical Processes involved_. The
mountain<br>
range can only arise where the geosyncline is deeply filled
by<br>
long ages of sedimentation.</p>
<p>Dana's description of the events attending mountain building
is<br>
impressive:</p>
<p>"A mountain range of the common type, like that to which
the<br>
Appalachians belong, is made out of the sedimentary formations
of<br>
a long preceding era; beds that were laid down conformably,
and<br>
in succession, until they had reached the needed thickness;
beds<br>
spreading over a region tens of thousands of square miles in<br>
area. The region over which sedimentary formations were in<br>
progress in order to make, finally, the Appalachian range,<br>
reached from New York to Alabama, and had a breadth of 100 to
200<br>
miles, and the pile of horizontal beds along the middle was<br>
40,000 feet in depth. The pile for the Wahsatch Mountains was<br>
60,000 feet thick, according to King. The beds for the<br>
Appalachians were not laid down in a deep ocean, but in
shallow<br>
waters, where a gradual subsidence was in progress; and they
at<br>
last, when ready for the genesis, lay in a trough 40,000 feet<br>
deep, filling the trough to the brim. It thus appears that
epochs<br>
of mountain-making have occurred only after long intervals of<br>
quiet in the history of a continent."[1]</p>
<p>[1] Dana, _Manual of Geology_, third edition, p. 794</p>
<p>120</p>
<p>On the western side of North America the work of<br>
mountain-building was, indeed, on the grandest scale. For
long<br>
ages and through a succession of geological epochs,
sedimentation<br>
had proceeded so that the accumulations of Palaeozoic and<br>
Mesozoic times had collected in the geosyncline formed by
their<br>
own ever increasing weight. The site of the future Laramide
range<br>
was in late Cretaceous times occupied by some 50,000 feet of<br>
sedimentary deposits; but the limit had apparently been
attained,<br>
and at this time the Laramide range, as well as its southerly<br>
continuation into the United States, the Rockies, had their<br>
beginning. Chamberlin and Salisbury[1] estimate that the
height<br>
of the mountains developed in the Laramide range at this time
was<br>
20,000 feet, and that, owing to the further elevation which
has<br>
since taken place, from 32,000 to 35,000 feet would be their<br>
present height if erosion had not reduced them. Thus on
either<br>
side of the American continent we have the same forces at
work,<br>
throwing up mountain ridges where the sediments had formerly
been<br>
shed into the ocean.</p>
<p>These great events are of a rhythmic character; the crust, as
it<br>
were, pulsating under the combined influences of
sedimentation<br>
and denudation. The first involves downward movements under a<br>
gathering load, and ultimately a reversal of the movement to
one<br>
of upheaval; the second factor, which throughout has been in</p>
<p>[1] Chamberlin and Salisbury, _Geology_, 1906, iii., 163.</p>
<p>121</p>
<p>operation as creator of the sediments, then intervenes as
an<br>
assailant of the newly-raised mountains, transporting their<br>
materials again to the ocean, when the rhythmic action is<br>
restored to its first phase, and the age-long sequence of
events<br>
must begin all over again.</p>
<p>It has long been inferred that compressive stress in the
crust<br>
must be a primary condition of these movements. The wvork<br>
required to effect the upheavals must be derived from some<br>
preexisting source of energy. The phenomenon&mdash;intrinsically
one of<br>
folding of the crust&mdash;suggests the adjustment of the
earth-crust<br>
to a lessening radius; the fact that great mountain-building<br>
movements have simultaneously affected the entire earth is<br>
certainly in favour of the view that a generally prevailing
cause<br>
is at the basis of the phenomenon.</p>
<p>The compressive stresses must be confined to the upper few
miles<br>
of the crust, for, in fact, the downward increase of
temperature<br>
and pressure soon confers fluid properties on the medium, and<br>
slow tangential compression results in hydrostatic pressure<br>
rather than directed stresses. Thus the folding visible in
the<br>
mountain range, and the lateral compression arising
therefrom,<br>
are effects confined to the upper parts of the crust.</p>
<p>The energy which uplifts the mountain is probably a
surviving<br>
part of the original gravitational potential energy of the
crust<br>
itself. It must be assumed that the crust in following
downwards<br>
the shrinking subcrustal magma, develops immense compressive<br>
stresses in</p>
<p>122</p>
<p>its materials, vast geographical areas being involved.
When<br>
folding at length takes place along the axis of the elongated<br>
syncline of deposition, the stresses find relief probably for<br>
some hundreds of miles, and the region of folding now becomes<br>
compressed in a transverse direction. As an illustration, the<br>
Laramide range, according to Dawson, represents the reduction
of<br>
a surface-belt 50 miles wide to one of 25 miles. The
marvellous<br>
translatory movements of crustal folds from south to north<br>
arising in the genesis of the Swiss Alps, which recent
research<br>
has brought to light, is another example of these movements
of<br>
relief, which continue to take place perhaps for many millions
of<br>
years after they are initiated.</p>
<p>The result of this yielding of the crust is a buckling of
the<br>
surface which on the whole is directed upwards; but
depression<br>
also is an attendant, in many cases at least, on mountain<br>
upheaval. Thus we find that the ocean floor is depressed into
a<br>
syncline along the western coast of South America; a trough<br>
always parallel to the ranges of the Andes. The downward<br>
deflection of the crust is of course an outcome of the same<br>
compressive stresses which elevate the mountain.</p>
<p>The fact that the yielding of the crust is always situated
where<br>
the sediments have accumulated to the greatest depth, has led
to<br>
attempts from time to time of establishing a physical
connexion<br>
between the one and the other. The best-known of these
theories<br>
is that of Babbage and Herschel. This seeks the connexion in
the<br>
rise of the</p>
<p>123</p>
<p>geotherms into the sinking mass of sediment and the
consequent<br>
increase of temperature of the earth-crust beneath. It will
be<br>
understood that as these isogeotherms, or levels at which the<br>
temperature is the same, lie at a uniform distance from the<br>
surface all over the Earth, unless where special variations
of<br>
conductivity may disturb them, the introduction of material<br>
pressed downwards from above must result in these materials<br>
partaking of the temperature proper to the depth to which
they<br>
are depressed. In other words the geotherms rise into the
sinking<br>
sediments, always, however, preserving their former average<br>
distance from the surface. The argument is that as this
process<br>
undoubtedly involves the heating up of that portion of the
crust<br>
which the sediments have displaced downwards, the result must
be<br>
a local enfeeblement of the crust, and hence these areas
become<br>
those of least resistance to the stresses in the crust.</p>
<p>When this theory is examined closely, we see that it only
amounts<br>
to saying that the bedded rocks, which have taken the place
of<br>
the igneous materials beneath, as a part of the rigid crust
of<br>
the Earth, must be less able to withstand compressive stress
than<br>
the average crust. For there has been no absolute rise of the<br>
geotherms, the thermal conductivities of both classes of<br>
materials differing but little. Sedimentary rock has merely
taken<br>
the place of average crust-rock, and is subjected to the same<br>
average temperature and pressure prevailing in the
surrounding<br>
crust. But are there any grounds for the</p>
<p>124</p>
<p>assumption that the compressive resistance of a complex of<br>
sedimentary rocks is inferior to one of igneous materials?
The<br>
metamorphosed siliceous sediments are among the strongest
rocks<br>
known as regards resistance to compressive stress; and if<br>
limestones have indeed plastic qualities, it must be
remembered<br>
that their average amount is only some 5 per cent. of the
whole.<br>
Again, so far as rise of temperature in the upper crust may<br>
affect the question, a temperature which will soften an
average<br>
igneous rock will not soften a sedimentary rock, for the
reason<br>
that the effect of solvent denudation has been to remove
those<br>
alkaline silicates which confer fusibility.</p>
<p>When, however, we take into account the radioactive content
of<br>
the sediments the matter assumes a different aspect.</p>
<p>The facts as to the general distribution of radioactive<br>
substances at the surface, and in rocks which have come from<br>
considerable depths in the crust, lead us to regard as
certain<br>
the widespread existence of heat-producing radioactive
elements<br>
in the exterior crust of the Earth. We find, indeed, in this
fact<br>
an explanation&mdash;at least in part&mdash;of the outflow of
heat<br>
continually taking place at the surface as revealed by the
rising<br>
temperature inwards. And we conclude that there must be a<br>
thickness of crust amounting to some miles, containing the<br>
radioactive elements.</p>
<p>Some of the most recent measurements of the quantities of
radium<br>
and thorium in the rocks of igneous origin&mdash;_e.g._
granites,<br>
syenites, diorites, basalts, etc., show that the</p>
<p>125</p>
<p>radioactive heat continually given out by such rocks amounts
to<br>
about one millionth part of 0.6 calories per second per cubic<br>
metre of average igneous rock. As we have to account for the<br>
escape of about 0.0014 calorie[1] per square metre of the
Earth's<br>
surface per second (assuming the rise of temperature
downwards,<br>
_i.e._ the "gradient" of temperature, to be one degree
centigrade<br>
in 35 metres) the downward extension of such rocks might,
_prima<br>
facie_, be as much as 19 kilometres.</p>
<p>About this calculation we have to observe that we assume
the<br>
average radioactivity of the materials with which we have
dealt<br>
at the surface to extend uniformly all the way down, _i.e._
that<br>
our experiments reveal the average radioactivity of a
radioactive<br>
crust. There is much to be said for this assumption. The
rocks<br>
which enter into the measurements come from all depths of the<br>
crust. It is highly probable that the less silicious, _i.e._
the<br>
more basic, rocks, mainly come from considerable depths; the
more<br>
acid or silica-rich rocks, from higher levels in the crust.
The<br>
radioactivity determined as the mean of the values for these
two<br>
classes of rock closely agrees with that found for
intermediate<br>
rocks, or rocks containing an intermediate amount of silica.<br>
Clarke contends that this last class of material probably<br>
represents the average composition of the Earth's crust so far
as<br>
it has been explored by us.</p>
<p>[1] The calorie referred to is the quantity of heat required
to<br>
heat one gram of water, _i.e._ one cubic centimetre of<br>
water&mdash;through one degree centigrade.</p>
<p>126</p>
<p>It is therefore highly probable that the value found for the
mean<br>
radioactivity of acid and basic rocks, or that found for<br>
intermediate rocks, truly represents the radioactive state of
the<br>
crust to a considerable depth. But it is easy to show that we<br>
cannot with confidence speak of the thickness of this crust
as<br>
determinable by equating the heat outflow at the surface with
the<br>
heat production of this average rock.</p>
<p>This appears in the failure of a radioactive layer, taken at
a<br>
thickness of about 19-kilometres, to account for the
deep-seated<br>
high temperatures which we find to be indicated by volcanic<br>
phenomena at many places on the surface. It is not hard to
show<br>
that the 19-kilometre layer would account for a temperature
no<br>
higher than about 270&deg; &gt;C. at its base.</p>
<p>It is true that this will be augmented beneath the
sedimentary<br>
deposits as we shall presently see; and that it is just in<br>
association with these deposits that deep-seated temperatures
are<br>
most in evidence at the surface; but still the result that
the<br>
maximum temperature beneath the crust in general attains a
value<br>
no higher than 270&deg; C. is hardly tenable. We conclude, then,
that<br>
some other source of heat exists beneath. This may be
radioactive<br>
in origin and may be easily accounted for if the radioactive<br>
materials are more sparsely distributed at the base of the
upper<br>
crust. Or, again, the heat may be primeval or original heat,<br>
still escaping from a cooling world. For our present purpose
it<br>
does not much matter which view</p>
<p>127</p>
<p>we adopt. But we must recognise that the calculated depth of
19<br>
kilometres of crust, possessing the average radioactivity of
the<br>
surface, is excessive; for, in fact, we are compelled by the<br>
facts to recognise that some other source of heat exists<br>
beneath.</p>
<p>If the observed surface gradient of temperature persisted<br>
uniformly downwards, at some 35 kilometres beneath the
surface<br>
there would exist temperatures (of about 1000&deg; C.) adequate
to<br>
soften basic rocks. It is probable, however, that the
gradient<br>
diminishes downwards, and that the level at which such<br>
temperatures exist lies rather deeper than this. It is,<br>
doubtless, somewhat variable according to local conditions;
nor<br>
can we at all approximate closely to an estimate of the depth
at<br>
which the fusion temperatures will be reached, for, in fact,
the<br>
existence of the radioactive layer very much complicates our<br>
estimates. In what follows we assume the depth of softening
to<br>
lie at about 40 kilometres beneath the surface of the normal<br>
crust; that is 25 miles down. It is to be observed that
Prestwich<br>
and other eminent geologists, from a study of the facts of<br>
crust-folding, etc., have arrived at similar estimates.[1] As
a<br>
further assumption we are probably not far wrong if we assign
to<br>
the radioactive part of this crust a thickness of about 10 or
12<br>
kilometres; _i.e._ six or seven miles. This is necessarily a<br>
rough approximation only; but the conclusions at which</p>
<p>[1] Prestwich, _Proc. Royal Soc._, xii., p. 158 _et seq._</p>
<p>128</p>
<p>we shall arrive are reached in their essential features
allowing<br>
a wide latitude in our choice of data. We shall speak of this<br>
part of the crust as the normal radioactive layer.</p>
<p>An important fact is evolved from the mathematical
investigation<br>
of the temperature conditions arising from the presence of such
a<br>
radioactive layer. It is found that the greatest temperature,
due<br>
to the radioactive heat everywhere evolved in the
layer&mdash;_i.e._<br>
the temperature at its base&mdash;is proportional to the square
of the<br>
thickness of the layer. This fact has a direct bearing on the<br>
influence of radioactivity upon mountain elevation; as we
shall<br>
now find.</p>
<p>The normal radioactive layer of the Earth is composed of
rocks<br>
extending&mdash;as we assume&mdash;approximately to a depth of 12
kilometres<br>
(7.5 miles). The temperature at the base of this layer due to
the<br>
heat being continually evolved in it, is, say,
t<sub>1</sub>&deg;. Now, let us<br>
suppose, in the trough of the geosyncline, and upon the top
of<br>
the normal layer, a deposit of, say, 10 kilometres (6.2 miles)
of<br>
sediments is formed during a long period of continental<br>
denudation. What is the effect of this on the temperature at
the<br>
base of the normal layer depressed beneath this load? The
total<br>
thickness of radioactive rocks is now 22 kilometres.
Accordingly<br>
we find the new temperature t<sub>2</sub>&deg;, by the proportion
t<sub>1</sub>&deg; : t<sub>2</sub>&deg; ::<br>
12&deg; : 22&deg; That is, as 144 to 484. In fact, the
temperature is more<br>
than trebled. It is true we here assume the radioactivity of
the<br>
sediments</p>
<p>129</p>
<p>and of the normal crust to be the same. The sediments are,<br>
however, less radioactive in the proportion of 4 to 3.<br>
Nevertheless the effects of the increased thickness will be<br>
considerable.</p>
<p>Now this remarkable increase in the temperature arises
entirely<br>
from the condition attending the radioactive heating; and<br>
involves something _additional_ to the temperature conditions<br>
determined by the mere depression and thickening of the crust
as<br>
in the Babbage-Herschel theory. The latter theory only involves
a<br>
_shifting_ of the temperature levels (or geotherms) into the<br>
deposited materials. The radioactive theory involves an
actual<br>
rise in the temperature at any distance from the surface; so
that<br>
_the level in the crust at which the rocks are softened is
nearer<br>
to the surface in the geosynclines than it is elsewhere in
the<br>
normal crust_ (Pl. XV, p. 118).</p>
<p>In this manner the rigid part of the crust is reduced in<br>
thickness where the great sedimentary deposits have collected.
A<br>
ten-kilometre layer of sediment might result in reducing the<br>
effective thickness of the crust by 30 per cent.; a<br>
fourteen-kilometre layer might reduce it by nearly 50 per
cent.<br>
Even a four-kilometre deposit might reduce the effective<br>
resistance of the crust to compressive forces, by 10 per
cent.</p>
<p>Such results are, of course, approximate only. They show that
as<br>
the sediments grow in depth there is a rising of the geotherm
of<br>
plasticity&mdash;whatever its true temperature may
be&mdash;gradually<br>
reducing the thickness of that part</p>
<p>130</p>
<p>of the upper crust which is bearing the simultaneously
increasing<br>
compressive stresses. Below this geotherm long-continued
stress<br>
resolves itself into hydrostatic pressure; above it (there is,
of<br>
course, no sharp line of demarcation) the crust accumulates<br>
elastic energy. The final yielding and flexure occur when the<br>
resistant cross-section has been sufficiently diminished. It
is<br>
probable that there is also some outward hydrostaitic thrust
over<br>
the area of rising temperature, which assists in determining
the<br>
upward throw of the folds.</p>
<p>When yielding has begun in any geosyncline, and the materials
are<br>
faulted and overthrust, there results a considerably
increased<br>
thickness. As an instance, consider the piling up of
sediments<br>
over the existing materials of the Alps, which resulted from
the<br>
compressive force acting from south to north in the progress
of<br>
Alpine upheaval. Schmidt of Basel has estimated that from 15
to<br>
20 kilometres of rock covered the materials of the Simplon as
now<br>
exposed, at the time when the orogenic forces were actively
at<br>
work folding and shearing the beds, and injecting into their<br>
folds the plastic gneisses coming from beneath.[1] The
lateral<br>
compression of the area of deposition of the Laramide,
already<br>
referred to, resulted in a great thickening of the deposits.
Many<br>
other cases might be cited; the effect is always in some
degree<br>
necessarily produced.</p>
<p>[1] Schmidt, Ec. Geol. _Helvelix_, vol. ix., No. 4, p. 590</p>
<p>131</p>
<p>If time be given for the heat to accumulate in the lower
depths<br>
of the crushed-up sediments, here is an additional source of<br>
increased temperature. The piled-up masses of the Simplon
might<br>
have occasioned a rise due to radioactive heating of one or
two<br>
hundred degrees, or even more; and if this be added to the<br>
interior heat, a total of from 800&deg; to 1000&deg; might have
prevailed<br>
in the rocks now exposed at the surface of the mountain. Even
a<br>
lesser temperature, accompanied by the intense pressure<br>
conditions, might well occasion the appearances of thermal<br>
metamorphism described by Weinschenk, and for which,
otherwise,<br>
there is difficulty in accounting.[1]</p>
<p>This increase upon the primarily developed temperature
conditions<br>
takes place concurrently with the progress of compression;
and<br>
while it cannot be taken into account in estimating the<br>
conditions of initial yielding of the crust, it adds an
element<br>
of instability, inasmuch as any progressive thickening by
lateral<br>
compression results in an accelerated rise of the goetherms.
It<br>
is probable that time sufficient for these effects to develop,
if<br>
not to their final, yet to a considerable extent, is often<br>
available. The viscous movements of siliceous materials, and
the<br>
out-pouring of igneous rocks which often attend mountain<br>
elevation, would find an explanation in such temperatures.</p>
<p>[1] Weinschenk, _Congr&egrave;s G&eacute;ol. Internat._, 1900,
i., p. 332.</p>
<p>132</p>
<p>There is no more striking feature of the part here played
by<br>
radioactivity than the fact that the rhythmic occurrence of<br>
depression and upheaval succeeding each other after great<br>
intervals of time, and often shifting their position but
little<br>
from the first scene of sedimentation, becomes accounted for.
The<br>
source of thermal energy, as we have already remarked, is in
fact<br>
transported with the sediments&mdash;that energy which determines
the<br>
place of yielding and upheaval, and ordains that the mountain<br>
ranges shall stand around the continental borders.
Sedimentation<br>
from this point of view is a convection of energy.</p>
<p>When the consolidated sediments are by these and by
succeeding<br>
movements forced upwards into mountains, they are exposed to<br>
denudative effects greatly exceeding those which affect the<br>
plains. Witness the removal during late Tertiary times of the<br>
vast thickness of rock enveloping the Alps. Such great masses
are<br>
hurried away by ice, rivers, and rain. The ocean receives
them;<br>
and with infinite patience the world awaits the slow
accumulation<br>
of the radioactive energy beginning afresh upon its work. The<br>
time for such events appears to us immense, for millions of
years<br>
are required for the sediments to grow in thickness, and the<br>
geotherms to move upwards; but vast as it is, it is but a
moment<br>
in the life of the parent radioactive substances, whose
atoms,<br>
hardly diminished in numbers, pursue their changes while the<br>
mountains come and go, and the</p>
<p>133</p>
<p>rudiments of life develop into its highest consummations.</p>
<p>To those unacquainted with the results of geological<br>
investigation the history of the mountains as deciphered in
the<br>
rocks seems almost incredible.</p>
<p>The recently published sections of the Himalaya, due to H.
H.<br>
Hayden and the many distinguished men who have contributed to
the<br>
Geological Survey of India, show these great ranges to be<br>
essentially formed of folded sediments penetrated by vast
masses<br>
of granite and other eruptives. Their geological history may
be<br>
summarised as follows</p>
<p>The Himalayan area in pre-Cambrian times was, in its
southwestern<br>
extension, part of the floor of a sea which covered much of
what<br>
is now the Indian Peninsula. In the northern shallows of this
sea<br>
were laid down beds of conglomerate, shale, sandstone and<br>
limestone, derived from the denudation of Arch&aelig;an rocks,
which,<br>
probably, rose as hills or mountains in parts of Peninsular
India<br>
and along the Tibetan edge of the Himalayan region. These
beds<br>
constitute the record of the long Purana Era[1] and are
probably<br>
coeval with the Algonkian of North America. Even in these
early<br>
times volcanic disturbances affected this area and the lower
beds<br>
of the Purana deposits were penetrated by volcanic outflows,<br>
covered by sheets of lava, uplifted, denuded and again
submerged</p>
<p>[1] See footnote, p. 139.</p>
<p>134</p>
<p>beneath the waters. Two such periods of instability have
left<br>
their records in the sediments of the Purana sea.</p>
<p>The succeeding era&mdash;the Dravidian Era&mdash;opens with
Haimanta<br>
(Cambrian) times. A shallow sea now extended over Kumaun,
Garwal,<br>
and Spiti, as well as Kashmir and ultimately over the Salt
Range<br>
region of the Punjab as is shown by deposits in these areas.
This<br>
sea was not, however, connected with the Cambrian sea of
Europe.<br>
The fossil faunas left by the two seas are distinct.</p>
<p>After an interval of disturbance during closing Haimanta
times,<br>
geographical changes attendant on further land movements<br>
occurred. The central sea of Asia, the Tethys, extended
westwards<br>
and now joined with the European Paleozoic sea; and deposits
of<br>
Ordovician and Silurian age were laid down:&mdash;the Muth
deposits.</p>
<p>The succeeding Devonian Period saw the whole Northern
Himalayan<br>
area under the waters of the Tethys which, eastward, extended
to<br>
Burma and China and, westward, covered Kashmir, the Hindu
Kush<br>
and part of Afghanistan. Deposits continued to be formed in
this<br>
area till middle Carboniferous times.</p>
<p>Near. the close of the Dravidian Era Kashmir became convulsed
by<br>
volcanic disturbance and the Penjal traps were ejected. It was
a<br>
time of worldwide disturbance and of redistribution of land
and<br>
water. Carboniferous times had begun, and the geographical<br>
changes in</p>
<p>135</p>
<p>the southern limits of the Tethys are regarded as ushering in
a<br>
new and last era in Indian geological history the Aryan Bra.</p>
<p>India was now part of Gondwanaland; that vanished continent
which<br>
then reached westward to South Africa and eastward to
Australia.<br>
A boulder-bed of glacial origin, the Talchir Boulder-bed,
occurs<br>
in many surviving parts of this great land. It enters largely<br>
into the Salt Range deposits. There is evidence that
extensive<br>
sheets of ice, wearing down the rocks of Rajputana, shoved
their<br>
moraines northward into the Salt Range Sea; then, probably, a<br>
southern extension of the Tethys.</p>
<p>Subsequent to this ice age the Indian coalfields of the
Gondwana<br>
were laid down, with beds rich in the Glossopteris and<br>
Gangamopteris flora. This remarkable carboniferous flora
extends<br>
to Southern Kashmir, so that it is to be inferred that this<br>
region was also part of the main Gondwanaland. But its
emergence<br>
was but for a brief period. Upper Carboniferous marine
deposits<br>
succeeded; and, in fact, there was no important discontinuity
in<br>
the deposits in this area from Panjal times till the early<br>
Tertiaries. During the whole of which vast period Kashmir was<br>
covered with the waters of the Tethys.</p>
<p>The closing Dravidian disturbances of the Kashmir region did
not,<br>
apparently, extend to the eastern Himalayan area. But the<br>
Carboniferous Period was, in this</p>
<p>136</p>
<p>eastern area, one of instability, culminating, at the close
of<br>
the Period, in a steady rise of the land and a northward
retreat<br>
of the Tethys. Nearly the entire Himalaya east of Kashmir
became<br>
a land surface and remained exposed to denudative forces for
so<br>
long a time that in places the whole of the Carboniferous,<br>
Devonian, and a large part of the Silurian and Ordovician<br>
deposits were removed&mdash;some thousands of feet in
thickness&mdash;before<br>
resubmergence in the Tethys occurred.</p>
<p>Towards the end of the Palaeozoic Age the Aryan Tethys
receded<br>
westwards, but still covered the Himalaya and was still
connected<br>
with the European Pal&aelig;ozoic sea. The Himalayan area (as
well as<br>
Kashmir) remained submerged in its waters throughout the
entire<br>
Mesozoic Age.</p>
<p>During Cretaceous times the Tethys became greatly
extended,<br>
indicating a considerable subsidence of northwestern India,<br>
Afghanistan, Western Asia, and, probably, much of Tibet. The<br>
shallow-water character of the deposits of the Tibetan
Himalaya<br>
indicates, however, a coast line near this region. Volcanic<br>
materials, now poured out, foreshadow the incoming of the
great<br>
mountain-building epoch of the Tertiary Era. The enormous mass
of<br>
the Deccan traps, possessing a volume which has been estimated
at<br>
as much as 6,000 cubic miles, was probably extruded over the<br>
Northern Peninsular region during late Cretaceous times. The
sea<br>
now began to retreat, and by the close of</p>
<p>137</p>
<p>the Eocene, it had moved westward to Sind and Baluchistan.
The<br>
movements of the Earth's crust were attended by intense
volcanic<br>
activity, and great volumes of granite were injected into the<br>
sediments, followed by dykes and outflows of basic lavas.</p>
<p>The Tethys vanished to return no more. It survives in the<br>
Mediterranean of today. The mountain-building movements
continued<br>
into Pliocene times. The Nummulite beds of the Eocene were,
as<br>
the result, ultimately uplifted 18,500 feet over sea level, a<br>
total uplift of not less than 20,000 feet.</p>
<p>Thus with many vicissitudes, involving intervals of
volcanic<br>
activity, local uplifting, and extensive local denudation,
the<br>
Himalaya, which had originated in the sediments of the
ancient<br>
Purana sea, far back in pre-Cambrian times, and which had<br>
developed potentially in a long sequence of deposits
collecting<br>
almost continuously throughout the whole of geological time,<br>
finally took their place high in the heavens, where only the<br>
winds&mdash;faint at such altitudes&mdash;and the lights of
heaven can visit<br>
their eternal snows.[1]</p>
<p>In this great history it is significant that the longest<br>
continuous series of sedimentary deposits which the world has<br>
known has become transfigured into the loftiest elevation
upon<br>
its surface.</p>
<p>[1] See A Sketch of the _Geography and Geology of the
Himalaya<br>
Mountains and Tibet_. By Colonel S. G. Burrard, R.E., F.R.S.,

<p>The diagrammatic sections of the Himalaya accompanying this
brief<br>
description arc taken from the monograph of Burrard and
Hayden<br>
(loc. cit.) on the Himalaya. Looking at the sections we see
that<br>
some of the loftiest summits are sculptured in granite and
other<br>
crystalline rocks. The appearance of these materials at the<br>
surface indicates the removal by denudation and the extreme<br>
metamorphism of much sedimentary deposit. The crystalline
rocks,<br>
indeed, penetrate some of the oldest rocks in the world. They<br>
appear in contact with Archaean, Algonkian or early
Palaeozoic<br>
rocks. A study of the sections reveals not only the severe
earth<br>
movements, but also the immense amount of sedimentary
deposits<br>
involved in the genesis of these alps. It will be noted that
the<br>
vertical scale is not exaggerated relatively to the<br>
horizontal.[1] Although there is no evidence of mountain<br>
building</p>

<p>on a large scale in the Himalayan area till the Tertiary<br>
upheaval, it is, in the majority of cases, literally correct
to<br>
speak of the mountains as having their generations like
organic<br>
beings, and passing through all the stages of birth, life,
death<br>
and reproduction. The Alps, the Jura, the Pyrenees, the
Andes,<br>
have been remade more than once in the course of geological
time,<br>
the _d&eacute;bris_ of a worn-out range being again uplifted in
succeeding<br>
ages.</p>
<p>Thus to dwell for a moment on one case only: that of the<br>
Pyrenees. The Pyrenees arose as a range of older Palmozoic
rocks<br>
in Devonian times. These early mountains, however, were<br>
sufficiently worn out and depressed by Carboniferous times to<br>
receive the deposits of that age laid down on the up-turned
edges<br>
of the older rocks. And to Carboniferous succeeded Permian,<br>
Triassic, Jurassic and Lower Cretaceous sediments all laid
down<br>
in conformable sequence. There was then fresh disturbance and<br>
upheaval followed by denudation, and these mountains, in
turn,<br>
became worn out and depressed beneath the ocean so that Upper<br>
Greensand rocks were laid down unconforrnably on all beneath.
To<br>
these now succeeded Upper Chalk, sediments of Danian age, and
so<br>
on, till Eocene times, when the tale was completed and the<br>
existing ranges rose from the sea. Today we find the folded<br>
Nummulitic strata of Eocene age uplifted 11,000 feet, or
within<br>
200 feet of the greatest heights of the Pyrenees. And so they<br>
stand awaiting</p>
<p>140</p>
<p>the time when once again they shall "fall into the portion
of<br>
outworn faces."[1]</p>
<p>Only mountains can beget mountains. Great accumulations of<br>
sediment are a necessary condition for the localisation of<br>
crust-flexure. The earliest mountains arose as purely igneous
or<br>
volcanic elevations, but the generations of the hills soon<br>
originated in the collection of the _d&eacute;bris_, under the
law of<br>
gravity, in the hollow places. And if a foundered range is<br>
exposed now to our view encumbered with thousands of feet of<br>
overlying sediments we know that while the one range was
sinking,<br>
another, from which the sediments were derived, surely
existed.<br>
Through the "windows" in the deep-cut rocks of the Swiss
valleys<br>
we see the older Carboniferous Alps looking out, revisiting
the<br>
sun light, after scores of millions of years of imprisonment.
We<br>
know that just as surely as the Alps of today are founding by<br>
their muddy torrents ranges yet to arise, so other primeval
Alps<br>
fed into the ocean the materials of these buried pre-Permian<br>
rocks.</p>
<p>This succession of events only can cease when the rocks have
been<br>
sufficiently impoverished of the heat-producing substances,
or<br>
the forces of compression shall have died out in the surface<br>
crust of the earth.</p>
<p>It seems impossible to escape the conclusion that in the
great<br>
development of ocean-encircling areas of</p>
<p>[1] See Prestwich, _Chemical and Physical Geology_, p.
302.</p>
<p>141</p>
<p>deposition and crustal folding, the heat of radioactivity
has<br>
been a determining factor. We recognise in the movements of
the<br>
sediments not only an influence localising and accelerating<br>
crustal movements, but one which, in subservience to the
primal<br>
distribution of land and water, has determined some of the<br>
greatest geographical features of the globe.</p>
<p>It is no more than a step to show that bound up with the<br>
radioactive energy are most of the earthquake and volcanic<br>
phenomena of the earth. The association of earthquakes with
the<br>
great geosynclines is well known. The work of De Montessus
showed<br>
that over 94 per cent. of all recorded shocks lie in the<br>
geosynclinal belts. There can be no doubt that these<br>
manifestations of instability are the results of the local<br>
weakness and flexure which originated in the accumulation of<br>
energy denuded from the continents. Similarly we may view in<br>
volcanoes phenomena referable to the same fundamental cause.
The<br>
volcano was, in fact, long regarded as more intimately
connected<br>
with earthquakes than it, probably, actually is; the
association<br>
being regarded in a causative light, whereas the connexion is<br>
more that of possessing a common origin. The girdle of
volcanoes<br>
around the Pacific and the earthquake belt coincide. Again,
the<br>
ancient and modern volcanoes and earthquakes of Europe are<br>
associated with the geosyncline of the greater Mediterranean,
the<br>
Tethys of Mesozoic times. There is no difficulty in
understanding<br>
in a</p>
<p>142</p>
<p>general way the nature of the association. The earthquake is
the<br>
manifestation of rupture and slip, and, as Suess has shown,
the<br>
epicentres shift along that fault line where the crust has<br>
yielded.[1] The volcano marks the spot where the zone of
fusion<br>
is brought so high in the fractured crust that the melted<br>
materials are poured out upon the surface.</p>
<p>In a recent work on the subject of earthquakes Professor
Hobbs<br>
writes: "One of the most interesting of the generalisations
which<br>
De Montessus has reached as a result of his protracted
studies,<br>
is that the earthquake districts on the land correspond
almost<br>
exactly to those belts upon the globe which were the almost<br>
continuous ocean basins of the long Secondary era of
geological<br>
history. Within these belts the sedimentary formations of the<br>
crust were laid down in the greatest thickness, and the<br>
formations follow each other in relatively complete
succession.<br>
For almost or quite the whole of this long era it is
therefore<br>
clear that the ocean covered these zones. About them the<br>
formations are found interrupted, and the lacuna indicate
that<br>
the sea invaded the area only to recede from it, and again at<br>
some later period to transgress upon it. For a long time,<br>
therefore, these earthquake belts were the sea
basins&mdash;the<br>
geosynclines. They became later the rising mountains of the<br>
Tertiary period, and mountains they</p>
<p>[1] Suess, _The Face of the Earth_, vol. ii., chap. ii.</p>
<p>143</p>
<p>are today. The earthquake belts are hence those portions of
the<br>
earth's crust which in recent times have suffered the
greatest<br>
movements in a vertical direction&mdash;they are the most
mobile<br>
portions of the earth's crust."[1] Whether the movements<br>
attending mountain elevation and denudation are a connected
and<br>
integral part of those wide geographical changes which result
in<br>
submergence and elevation of large continental areas, is an<br>
obscure and complex question. We seem, indeed, according to
the<br>
views of some authorities, hardly in a position to affirm
with<br>
certainty that such widespread movements of the land have<br>
actually occurred, and that the phenomena are not the outcome
of<br>
fluctuations of oceanic level; that our observations go no<br>
further than the recognition of positive and negative
movements<br>
of the strand. However this may be, the greater part of<br>
mechanical denudation during geological time has been done on
the<br>
mountain ranges. It is, in short, indisputable that the
orogenic<br>
movements which uplift the hills have been at the basis of<br>
geological history. To them the great accumulations of
sediments<br>
which now form so large a part of continental land are mainly<br>
due. There can be no doubt of the fact that these movements
have<br>
swayed the entire history, both inorganic and organic, of the<br>
world in which we live.</p>
<p>[1] Hobbs, _Earthquakes_, p. 58.</p>
<p>144</p>
<p>To sum the contents of this essay in the most general terms,
we<br>
find that in the conception of denudation as producing the<br>
convection and accumulation of radiothermal energy the
surface<br>
features of the globe receive a new significance. The heat of
the<br>
earth is not internal only, but rather a heat-source exists
at<br>
the surface, which, as we have seen, cannot prevail to the
same<br>
degree within; and when the conditions become favourable for
the<br>
aggregation of the energy, the crust, heated both from
beneath<br>
and from above, assumes properties more akin to those of its<br>
earlier stages of development, the secular heat-loss being<br>
restored in the radioactive supplies. These causes of local<br>
mobility have been in operation, shifting somewhat from place
to<br>
place, and defined geographically by the continental masses<br>
undergoing denudation, since the earliest times.</p>

<p><u>ALPINE STRUCTURE</u></p>
<p>AN intelligent observer of the geological changes progressing
in<br>
southern Europe in Eocene times would have seen little to
inspire<br>
him with a premonition of the events then developing. The<br>
Nummulitic limestones were being laid down in that enlarged<br>
Mediterranean which at this period, save for a few islands,<br>
covered most of south Europe. Of these stratified remains, as<br>
well as of the great beds of Cretaceous, Jurassic, Triassic,
and<br>
Permian sediments beneath, our hypothetical observer would<br>
probably have been regardless; just as today we observe, with
an<br>
indifference born of our transitoriness, the deposits rapidly<br>
gathering wherever river discharge is distributing the
sediments<br>
over the sea-floor, or the lime-secreting organisms are
actively<br>
at work. And yet it took but a few millions of years to
uplift<br>
the deposits of the ancient Tethys; pile high its sediments
in<br>
fold upon fold in the Alps, the Carpathians, and the
Himalayas;<br>
and&mdash;exposing them to the rigours of denudation at altitudes
where<br>
glaciation, landslip, and torrent prevail&mdash;inaugurate a new
epoch<br>
of sedimentation and upheaval.</p>
<p>146</p>
<p>In the case of the Alps, to which we wish now specially to
refer,<br>
the chief upheaval appears to have been in Oligocene times,<br>
although movement continued to the close of the Pliocene.
There<br>
was thus a period of some millions of years within which the<br>
entire phenomena were comprised. Availing ourselves of
Sollas'<br>
computations,[1] we may sum the maximum depths of sedimentary<br>
deposits of the geological periods concerned as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>Pliocene - - - - - 3,950 m.</p>
<p>Miocene  - - - - - 4,250 m.</p>
<p>Oligocene  - - - - 3,660 m.</p>
<p>Eocene - - - - - - 6,100 m.</p>
<p>and assuming that the orogenic forces began their work in
the<br>
last quarter of the Eocene period, we have a total of 13,400
m.<br>
as some measure of the time which elapsed. At the rate of io<br>
centimetres in a century these deposits could not have
collected<br>
in less than 13.4 millions of years. It would appear that not<br>
less than some ten millions of years were consumed in the
genesis<br>
of the Alps before constructive movements finally ceased.</p>
<p>The progress of the earth-movements was attended by the
usual<br>
volcanic phenomena. The Oligocene and Miocene volcanoes
extended<br>
in a band marked by the Auvergne, the Eiffel, the Bohemian,
and<br>
the eastern Carpathian eruptions; and, later, towards the
close<br>
of the movements in Pliocene times, the south border</p>
<p>[1] Sollas, Anniversary Address, Geol. Soc., London, 1909.</p>
<p>147</p>
<p>regions of the Alps became the scene of eruptions such as
those<br>
of Etna, Santorin, Somma (Vesuvius), etc.</p>
<p>We have referred to these well-known episodes with two objects
in<br>
view: to recall to mind the time-interval involved, and the<br>
evidence of intense crustal disturbance, both dynamic and<br>
thermal. According to views explained in a previous essay,
the<br>
energetic effects of radium in the sediments and upper crust
were<br>
a principal factor in localising and bringing about these<br>
results. We propose now to inquire if, also, in the more
intimate<br>
structure of the Alps, the radioactive energy may not have
borne<br>
a part.</p>
<p>What we see today in the Alps is but a residue spared by<br>
denudation. It is certain that vast thicknesses of material
have<br>
disappeared. Even while constructive effects were still in<br>
progress, denudative forces were not idle. Of this fact the<br>
shingle accumulations of the Molasse, where, on the northern<br>
borders of the Alps, they stand piled into mountains, bear<br>
eloquent testimony. In the sub-Apennine series of Italy, the<br>
great beds of clays, marls, and limestones afford evidence of<br>
these destructive processes continued into Pliocene times. We<br>
have already referred to Schmidt's estimate that the
sedimentary<br>
covering must have in places amounted to from 15,000 to
20,000<br>
metres. The evidence for this is mainly tectonic or
structural;<br>
but is partly forthcoming in the changes which the materials
now<br>
open to our inspection plainly reveal. Thus it is impos-</p>
<p>148</p>
<p>sible to suppose that gneissic rocks can become so far plastic
as<br>
to flow in and around the calcareous sediments, or be
penetrated<br>
by the latter&mdash;as we see in the Jungfrau and
elsewhere&mdash;unless<br>
great pressures and high temperatures prevailed. And,
according<br>
to some writers, the temperatures revealed by the intimate<br>
structural changes of rock-forming minerals must have amounted
to<br>
those of fusion. The existence of such conditions is supported
by<br>
the observation that where the.crystallisation is now the
most<br>
perfect, the phenomena of folding and injection are best<br>
developed.[1] These high temperatures would appear to be<br>
unaccountable without the intervention of radiothermal
effects;<br>
and, indeed, have been regarded as enigmatic by observers of
the<br>
phenomena in question. A covering of 20,000 metres in
thickness<br>
would not occasion an earth-temperature exceeding 500&deg; C. if
the<br>
gradients were such as obtain in mountain regions generally;
and<br>
600&deg; is about the limit we could ascribe to the purely
passive<br>
effects of such a layer in elevating the geotherms.</p>
<p>Those who are still unacquainted with the recently
published<br>
observations on the structure of the Alps may find it
difficult<br>
to enter into what has now to be stated; for the facts are,<br>
indeed, very different from the generally preconceived ideas
of<br>
mountain formation. Nor can we wonder that many geologists
for<br>
long held</p>
<p>[1] Weinschenk, C. R. _Congr&egrave;s G&eacute;ol._, 1900, p.
321, et seq.</p>
<p>149</p>
<p>back from admitting views which appeared so extreme.
Receptivity<br>
is the first virtue of the scientific mind; but, with every<br>
desire to lay aside prejudice, many felt unequal to the<br>
acceptance of structural features involving a folding of the<br>
earth-crust in laps which lay for scores of miles from country
to<br>
country, and the carriage of mountainous materials from the
south<br>
of the Alps to the north, leaving them finally as Alpine
ranges<br>
of ancient sediments reposing on foundations of more recent
date.<br>
The historian of the subject will have to relate how some who<br>
finally were most active in advancing the new views were at
first<br>
opposed to them. In the change of conviction of these eminent<br>
geologists we have the strongest proof of the convincing
nature<br>
of the observations and the reality of the tectonic features
upon<br>
which the recent views are founded.</p>
<p>The lesser mountains which stand along the northern border of
the<br>
great limestone Alps, those known as the Pr&eacute;alpes, present
the<br>
strange characteristic of resting upon materials younger than<br>
themselves. Such mountains as the remarkable-looking Mythen,
near<br>
Schwyz, for instance, are weathered from masses of Triassic
and<br>
Jurassic rock, and repose on the much more recent Flysch. In<br>
sharp contrast to the Flysch scenery, they stand as abrupt
and<br>
gigantic erratics, which have been transported from the
central<br>
zone of the Alps lying far to the south. They are strangers<br>
petrologically,</p>
<p>150</p>
<p>stratigraphically, and geographically,[1] to the locality
in<br>
which they now occur. The exotic materials may be dolomites,<br>
limestones, schists, sandstones, or rocks of igneous origin.
They<br>
show in every case traces of the severe dynamic actions to
which<br>
they have been subjected in transit. The igneous, like the<br>
sedimentary, klippen, can be traced to distant sources; to
the<br>
massif of Belladonne, to Mont Blanc, Lugano, and the Tyrol.
The<br>
Pr&eacute;alpes are, in fact, mountains without local roots.</p>
<p>In this last-named essential feature, the Pr&eacute;alpes do
not differ<br>
from the still greater limestone Alps which succeed them to
the<br>
south. These giants, _e.g._ the Jungfrau, Wetterhorn, Eiger,
etc.,<br>
are also without local foundations. They have been formed
from<br>
the overthrown and drawn-out anticlines of great crust-folds,<br>
whose synclines or roots are traceable to the south side of
the<br>
Rhone Valley. The Bernese Oberland originated in the piling-up
of<br>
four great sheets or recumbent folds, one of which is
continued<br>
into the Pr&eacute;alpes. With Lugeon[2] we may see in the
phenomenon of<br>
the formation of the Pr&eacute;alpes a detail; regarding it as a
normal<br>
expression of that mechanism which has created the Swiss
Alps.<br>
For these limestone masses of the Oberland are not indications
of<br>
a merely local shift of the sedimentary covering of the Alps.<br>
Almost the whole covering has</p>
<p>[1] De Lapparent, _Trait&eacute; de G&eacute;ologie_, p.
1,785.</p>
<p>[2] Lugeon, _Bulletin Soc. G&eacute;ol. de France_, 1901, p.
772.</p>
<p>151</p>
<p>been pushed over and piled up to the north. Lugeon[l]
concludes<br>
that, before denudation had done its work and cut off the<br>
Pr&eacute;alpes from their roots, there would have been found
sheets, to<br>
the number of eight, superimposed and extending between the
Mont<br>
Blanc massif and the massif of the Finsteraarhorn: these
sheets<br>
being the overthrown folds of the wrinkled sedimentary
covering.<br>
The general nature of the alpine structure</p>
<p>{Fig. 8}</p>
<p>will be understood from the presentation of it
diagrammatically<br>
after Schmidt of Basel (Fig. 8).[2] The section extends from<br>
north to south, and brings out the relations of the several<br>
recumbent folds. We must imagine almost the whole of these<br>
superimposed folds now removed from the central regions of
the<br>
Alps by denudation,</p>
<p>[1] Lugeon, _loc. cit._</p>
<p>[2] Schmidt, _Ec. Geol. Helvetiae_, vol. ix., No. 4.</p>
<p>152</p>
<p>and leaving the underlying gneisses rising through the remains
of<br>
Permian, Triassic, and Jurassic sediments; while to the north
the<br>
great limestone mountains and further north still, the
Pr&eacute;alpes,<br>
carved from the remains of the recumbent folds, now stand
with<br>
almost as little resemblance to the vanished mountains as the<br>
memories of the past have to its former intense reality.</p>
<p>These views as to the origin of the Alps, which are shared at
the<br>
present day by so many distinguished geologists, had their
origin<br>
in the labours of many now gone; dating back to Studer;
finding<br>
their inspiration in the work of Heim, Suess, and Marcel<br>
Bertrand; and their consummation in that of Lugeon, Schardt,<br>
Rothpletz, Schmidt, and many others. Nor must it be forgotten<br>
that nearer home, somewhat similar phenomena, necessarily on
a<br>
smaller scale, were recognised by Lapworth, twenty-six years
ago,<br>
in his work on the structure of the Scottish Highlands.</p>
<p>An important tectonic principle underlies the development of
the<br>
phenomena we have just been reviewing. The uppermost of the<br>
superimposed recumbent folds is more extended in its
development<br>
than those which lie beneath. Passing downwards from the
highest<br>
of the folds, they are found to be less and less extended both
in<br>
the northerly and in the southerly direction, speaking of the<br>
special case&mdash;the Alps&mdash;now before us. This feature
might be<br>
described somewhat differently. We might say that those folds<br>
which had their roots farther</p>
<p>153</p>
<p>to the south were the most drawn-out towards the north: or
again<br>
we might say that the synclinal or deep-seated part of the
fold<br>
has lagged behind the anticlinal or what was originally the<br>
highest part of the fold, in the advance of the latter to the<br>
north. The anticline has advanced relatively to the syncline.
To<br>
this law one exception only is observed in the Swiss Alps;
the<br>
sheet of the Br&egrave;che (_Byecciendecke_) falls short, in its
northerly<br>
extension, of the underlying fold, which extends to form the<br>
Pr&eacute;alpes.</p>
<p>Contemplating such a generalised section as Professor
Schmidt's,<br>
or, indeed, more particular sections, such as those in the
Mont<br>
Blanc Massif by Marcel Bertrand,[1] of the Dent de Morcles,<br>
Diablerets, Wildhorn, and Massif de la Br&egrave;che by
Lugeon,[2] or<br>
finally Termier's section of the Pelvoux Massif,[3] one is<br>
reminded of the breaking of waves on a sloping beach. The
wave,<br>
retarded at its base, is carried forward above by its
momentum,<br>
and finally spreads far up on the strand; and if it could
there<br>
remain, the succeeding wave must necessarily find itself<br>
superimposed upon the first. But no effects of inertia, no<br>
kinetic effects, may be called to our aid in explaining the<br>
formation of mountains. Some geologists have accordingly
supposed<br>
that in order to account for</p>
<p>[1] Marcel Bertrand, _Cong. G&eacute;ol. Internat._, 1900,
Guide G&eacute;ol.,<br>
xiii. a, p. 41.</p>
<p>[2] Lugeon, _loc. cit._, p. 773.</p>
<p>[3] De Lapparent, _Traite de G&eacute;ol._, p. 1,773.</p>
<p>154</p>
<p>the recumbent folds and the peculiar phenomena of
increasing<br>
overlap, or _d&eacute;ferlement_, an obstacle, fixed and
deep-seated, must<br>
have arrested the roots or synclines of the folds, and held
them<br>
against translational motion, while a movement of the upper
crust<br>
drew out and carried forward the anticlines. Others have<br>
contented themselves by recording the facts without advancing
any<br>
explanatory hypothesis beyond that embodied in the
incontestable<br>
statement that such phenomena must be referred to the effects
of<br>
tangential forces acting in the Earth's crust.</p>
<p>It would appear that the explanation of the phenomena of<br>
recumbent folds and their _d&eacute;ferlement_ is to be obtained
directly<br>
from the temperature conditions prevailing throughout the<br>
stressed pile of rocks; and here the subject of mountain<br>
tectonics touches that with which we were elsewhere specially<br>
concerned&mdash;the geological influence of accumulated
radioactive<br>
energy.</p>
<p>As already shown[1], a rise of temperature due to this source
of<br>
several hundred degrees might be added to such temperatures
as<br>
would arise from the mere blanketing of the Earth, and the<br>
consequent upward movement of the geotherms. The time element
is<br>
here the most important consideration. The whole sequence of<br>
events from the first orogenic movements to the final upheaval
in<br>
Pliocene times must probably have occupied not less than ten<br>
million years.</p>
<p>[1] _Mountain Genesis_, p. 129, et seq.</p>
<p>155</p>
<p>Unfortunately the full investigation of the distribution
of<br>
temperature after any given time is beset with difficulties;
the<br>
conditions being extremely complex. If the radioactive
heating<br>
was strictly adiabatic&mdash;that is, if all the heat was
conserved and<br>
none entered from without&mdash;the time required for the
attainment of<br>
the equilibrium radioactive temperature would be just about
six<br>
million years. The conditions are not, indeed, adiabatic; but,
on<br>
the other hand, the rocks upraised by lateral pressure were by
no<br>
means at 0&deg; C. to start with. They must be assumed to
have<br>
possessed such temperatures as the prior radiothermal
effects,<br>
and the conducted heat from the Earth's interior, may have<br>
established.</p>
<p>It would from this appear probable that if a duration of
ten<br>
million years was involved, the equilibrium radioactive<br>
temperatures must nearly have been attained. The effects of
heat<br>
conducted from the underlying earthcrust have to be added,<br>
leading to a further rise in temperature of not less than
500&deg; or<br>
600&deg; . In such considerations the observed indications of
high<br>
temperatures in materials now laid bare by denudation,
probably<br>
find their explanation (P1. XIX).</p>
<p>The first fact that we infer from the former existence of such
a<br>
temperature distribution is the improbability, indeed the<br>
impossibility, that anything resembling a rigid obstacle, or<br>
deep-seated "horst," can have existed beneath the present<br>
surface-level, and opposed the northerly movement of the<br>
deep-lying synclines. For</p>
<p>156</p>
<p>such a horst can only have been constituted of some
siliceous<br>
rock-material such as we find everywhere rising through the<br>
worn-down sediments of the Alps; and the idea that this could<br>
retain rigidity under the prevailing temperature conditions,
must<br>
be dismissed. There is no need to labour this question; the
horst<br>
cannot have existed. To what, then, is the retardation of the<br>
lower parts of the folds, their overthrow, above, to the
north,<br>
and their _d&eacute;ferlement_, to be ascribed?</p>
<p>A little consideration shows that the very conditions of
high<br>
temperature and viscosity, which render untenable the
hypothesis<br>
of a rigid obstacle, suffice to afford a full explanation of
the<br>
retardation of the roots of the folds. For directed
translatory<br>
movements cannot be transmitted through a fluid, pressure in<br>
which is necessarily hydrostatic, and must be exerted equally
in<br>
every direction. And this applies, not only to a fluid, but to
a<br>
body which will yield viscously to an impressed force. There
will<br>
be a gradation, according as viscosity gives place to
rigidity,<br>
between the states in which the applied force resolves itself<br>
into a purely hydrostatic pressure, and in which it is<br>
transmitted through the material as a directed thrust. The
nature<br>
of the force, in the most general case, of course, has to be<br>
considered; whether it is suddenly applied and of brief
duration,<br>
or steady and long-continued. The latter conditions alone
apply<br>
to the present case.</p>
<p>It follows from this that, although a tangential force</p>
<p>157</p>
<p>or pressure be engendered by a crustal movement occurring to
the<br>
south, and the resultant effects be transmitted northwards,
these<br>
stresses can only mechanically affect the rigid parts of the<br>
crust into which they are carried. That is to say, they may<br>
result in folding and crushing, or horizontally transporting,
the<br>
upper layers of the Earth's crust; but in the deeper-lying<br>
viscous materials they must be resolved into hydrostatic
pressure<br>
which may act to upheave the overlying covering, but must
refuse<br>
to transmit the horizontal translatory movements affecting
the<br>
rigid materials above.</p>
<p>Between the regions in which these two opposing conditions<br>
prevail there will be no hard and fast line; but with the<br>
downward increase of fluidity there will be a gradual failure
of<br>
the mechanical conditions and an increase of the hydrostatic.<br>
Thus while the uppermost layers of the crust may be
transported<br>
to the full amount of the crustal displacement acting from
the<br>
south (speaking still of the Alps) deeper down there will be
a<br>
lesser horizontal movement, and still deeper there is no<br>
influence to urge the viscous rock-materials in a northerly<br>
direction. The consequences of these conditions must be the<br>
recumbence of the folds formed under the crust-stress, and
their<br>
_d&eacute;ferlement_ towards the north. To see this, we must
follow the<br>
several stages of development.</p>
<p>The earliest movements, we may suppose, result in flexures of
the<br>
Jura-Mountain type&mdash;that is, in a</p>
<p>158</p>
<p>succession of undulations more or less symmetrical. As the<br>
orogenic force continues and develops, these undulations give<br>
place to folds, the limbs of which are approximately
vertical,<br>
and the synclinal parts of which become ever more and more<br>
depressed into the deeper, and necessarily hotter, underlying<br>
materials; the anticlines being probably correspondingly<br>
elevated. These events are slowly developed, and the
temperature<br>
beneath is steadily rising in consequence of the conducted<br>
interior heat, and the steady accumulation of radioactive
energy<br>
in the sedimentary rocks and in the buried radioactive layer
of<br>
the Earth. The work expended on the crushed and sheared rock
also<br>
contributes to the developing temperature. Thus the geotherms<br>
must move upwards, and the viscous conditions extend from
below;<br>
continually diminishing the downward range of the translatory<br>
movements progressing in the higher parts. While above the
folded<br>
sediments are being carried northward, beneath they are
becoming<br>
anchored in the growing viscosity of the medium. The
anticlines<br>
will bend over, and the most southerly of the folds will<br>
gradually become pushed or bent over those lying to the
north.<br>
Finally, the whole upper part of the sheaf will become<br>
horizontally recumbent; and as the uppermost folds will be
those<br>
experiencing the greatest effects of the continued
displacement,<br>
the _d&eacute;ferlement_ or overlap must necessarily arise.</p>
<p>We may follow these stages of mountain evolution</p>
<p>159</p>
<p>in a diagram (Fig. 9) in which we eliminate intermediate<br>
conditions, and regard the early and final stages of
development<br>
only. In the upper sketch we suppose the lateral compression
much<br>
developed and the upward movement of the geotherms in
progress.<br>
The dotted line may be assumed to be a geotherm having a<br>
temperature of viscosity. If the conditions here shown
persist</p>
<p>{Fig. 9}</p>
<p>indefinitely, there is no doubt that the only further<br>
developments possible are the continued crushing of the
sediments<br>
and the bodily displacement of the whole mass to the north.
The<br>
second figure is intended to show in what manner these
results<br>
are evaded. The geotherm of viscosity has risen. All above it
is<br>
affected mechanically by the continuing stress, and borne<br>
northwards in varying</p>
<p>160</p>
<p>degree depending upon the rigidity. The folds have been<br>
overthrown and drawn out; those which lay originally most to
the<br>
south have become the uppermost; and, experiencing the
maximum<br>
amount of displacement, overlap those lying beneath. There
has<br>
also been a certain amount of upthrow owing to the
hydrostatic<br>
pressure. This last-mentioned element of the phenomena is of<br>
highly indeterminate character, for we know not the limits to<br>
which the hydrostatic pressure may be transmitted, and where
it<br>
may most readily find relief. While, according to some of the<br>
published sections, the uplifting force would seem to have<br>
influenced the final results of the orogenic movements, a<br>
discussion of its effects would not be profitable.</p>
<p>161</p>
<p><u>OTHER MINDS THAN OURS?</u></p>
<p>IN the year 1610 Galileo, looking through his telescope
then<br>
newly perfected by his own hands, discovered that the planet<br>
Jupiter was attended by a train of tiny stars which went
round<br>
and round him just as the moon goes round the Earth.</p>
<p>It was a revelation too great to be credited by mankind. It
was<br>
opposed to the doctrine of the centrality of the Earth, for
it<br>
suggested that other worlds constituted like ours might exist
in<br>
the heavens.</p>
<p>Some said it was a mere optic illusion; others that he who
looked<br>
through such a tube did it at the peril of his soul&mdash;it was
but a<br>
delusion of Satan. Galileo converted a few of the unbelievers
who<br>
had the courage to look through his telescope. To the others
he<br>
said, he hoped they would see those moons on their way to
heaven.<br>
Old as this story is it has never lost its pathos or its<br>
teaching.</p>
<p>The spirit which assailed Galileo's discoveries and which
finally<br>
was potent to overshadow his declining years, closed in
former<br>
days the mouths of those who asked the question written at
the<br>
head of this lecture: "Are we to believe that there are other<br>
minds than ours?"</p>
<p>162</p>
<p>Today we consider the question in a very different spirit.
Few<br>
would regard it as either foolish or improper. Its intense<br>
interest would be admitted by all, and but for the
limitations<br>
closing our way on every side it would, doubtless, attract
the<br>
most earnest investigation. Even on the mere balance of
judgment<br>
between the probable and the improbable, we have little to go
on.<br>
We know nothing definitely as to the conditions under which
life<br>
may originate: whether these are such as to be rare almost to<br>
impossibility, or common almost to certainty. Only within
narrow<br>
limits of temperature and in presence of certain of the
elements,<br>
can life like ours exist, and outside these conditions life,
if<br>
such there be, must be different from ours. Once originated it
is<br>
so constituted as to assail the energies around it and to
advance<br>
from less to greater. Do we know more than these vague facts?<br>
Yes, we have in our experience one other fact and one
involving<br>
much.</p>
<p>We know that our world is very old; that life has been for
many<br>
millions of years upon it; and that Man as a thinking being
is<br>
but of yesterday. Here is then a condition to be fulfilled.
To<br>
every world is physically assigned a limit to the period
during<br>
which it is habitable according to our knowledge of life and
its<br>
necessities. This limit passed and rationality missed, the
chance<br>
for that world is gone for ever, and other minds than ours<br>
assuredly will not from it contemplate the universe. Looking
at<br>
our own world we see that the tree of life has,</p>
<p>163</p>
<p>indeed, branched, leaved and, possibly, budded many times;
it<br>
never bloomed but once.</p>
<p>All difficulties dissolve and speculations become needless
under<br>
one condition only: that in which rationality may be inferred<br>
directly or indirectly by our observations on some sister
world<br>
in space, This is just the evidence which in recent years has<br>
been claimed as derived from a study of the surface of Mars.
To<br>
that planet our hope of such evidence is restricted. Our
survey<br>
in all other directions is barred by insurmountable
difficulties.<br>
Unless some meteoric record reached our Earth, revelationary
of<br>
intelligence on a perished world, our only hope of obtaining
such<br>
evidence rests on the observation of Mars' surface features.
To<br>
this subject we confine our attention in what follows.</p>
<p>The observations made during recent years upon the surface<br>
features of Mars have, excusably enough, given rise to<br>
sensational reports. We must consider under what
circumstances<br>
these observations have been made.</p>
<p>Mars comes into particularly favourable conditions for<br>
observation every fifteen years. It is true that every two
years<br>
and two months we overtake him in his orbit and he is then in<br>
"opposition." That is, the Earth is between him and the sun:
he<br>
is therefore in the opposite part of the heavens to the sun.
Now<br>
Mars' orbit is very excentric, sometimes he is 139 million
miles<br>
from the sun, and sometimes he as as much as 154 million
miles<br>
from the sun. The Earth's orbit is, by comparison, almost</p>
<p>164</p>
<p>a circle. Evidently if we pass him when he is nearest to the
sun<br>
we see him at his best; not only because he is then nearest
to<br>
us, but because he is then also most brightly lit. In such<br>
favourable oppositions we are within 35 million miles of him;
if<br>
Mars was in aphelion we would pass him at a distance of 61<br>
million miles. Opposition occurs under the most favourable<br>
circumstances every fifteen years. There was one in 1862,
another<br>
in 1877, one in 1892, and so on.</p>
<p>When Mars is 35 million miles off and we apply a telescope<br>
magnifying 1,000 diameters, we see him as if placed 35,000
miles<br>
off. This would be seven times nearer than we see the moon
with<br>
the naked eye. As Mars has a diameter about twice as great as<br>
that of the moon, at such a distance he would look fourteen
times<br>
the diameter of the moon. Granting favourable conditions of<br>
atmosphere much should be seen.</p>
<p>But these are just the conditions of atmosphere of which most
of<br>
the European observatories cannot boast. It is to the honour
of<br>
Schiaparelli, of Milan, that under comparatively unfavourable<br>
conditions and with a small instrument, he so far outstripped
his<br>
contemporaries in the observation of the features of Mars
that<br>
those contemporaries received much of his early discoveries
with<br>
scepticism. Light and dark outlines and patches on the
planet's<br>
surface had indeed been mapped by others, and even a couple
of<br>
the canals sighted; but at the opposition of 1877
Schiaparelli<br>
first mapped any considerable</p>
<p>165</p>
<p>number of the celebrated "canals" and showed that these<br>
constituted an extraordinary and characteristic feature of
the<br>
planet's geography. He called them "canali," meaning thereby<br>
"channels." It is remarkable indeed that a mistranslation
appears<br>
really responsible for the initiation of the idea that these<br>
features are canals.</p>
<p>In 1882 Schiaparelli startled the astronomical world by
declaring<br>
that he saw some of the canals double&mdash;that is appearing as
two<br>
parallel lines. As these lines span the planet's surface for<br>
distances of many thousands of miles the announcement
naturally<br>
gave rise to much surprise and, as I have said, to much<br>
scepticism. But he resolutely stuck to his statement. Here is
his<br>
map of 1882. It is sufficiently startling.</p>
<p>In 1892 he drew a new map. It adds a little to the former
map,<br>
but the doubling was not so well seen. It is just the
strangest<br>
feature about this doubling that at times it is conspicuous,
at<br>
times invisible. A line which is distinctly seen as a single
line<br>
at one time, a few weeks later will appear distinctly to
consist<br>
of two parallel lines; like railway tracks, but tracks
perhaps<br>
200 miles apart and up to 3,000 or even 4,000 miles in
length.</p>
<p>Many speculations were, of course, made to account for the
origin<br>
of such features. No known surface peculiarity on the Earth
or<br>
moon at all resembles these features. The moon's surface as
you<br>
know is cracked and</p>
<p>166</p>
<p>streaked. But the cracks are what we generally find cracks
to<br>
be&mdash;either aimless, wandering lines, or, if radiating from
a<br>
centre, then lines which contract in width as they leave the<br>
point of rupture. Where will we find cracks accurately
parallel<br>
to one another sweeping round a planet's face with steady<br>
curvature for, 4,000 miles, and crossing each other as if
quite<br>
unhampered by one another's presence? If the phenomenon on
Mars<br>
be due to cracks they imply a uniformity in thickness and<br>
strength of crust, a homogeneity, quite beyond all
anticipation.<br>
We will afterwards see that the course of the lines is itself<br>
further opposed to the theory that haphazard cracking of the<br>
crust of the planet is responsible for the lines. It was also<br>
suggested that the surface of the planet was covered with ice
and<br>
that these were cracks in the ice. This theory has even
greater<br>
difficulties than the last to contend with. Rivers have been<br>
suggested. A glance at our own maps at once disposes of this<br>
hypothesis. Rivers wander just as cracks do and parallel
rivers<br>
like parallel cracks are unknown.</p>
<p>In time the many suggestions were put aside. One only
remained.<br>
That the lines are actually the work of intelligence;
actually<br>
are canals, artificially made, constructed for irrigation<br>
purposes on a scale of which we can hardly form any
conception<br>
based on our own earthly engineering structures.</p>
<p>During the opposition of 1894, Percival Lowell, along with A.
E.<br>
Douglass, and W. H. Pickering,</p>
<p>167</p>
<p>observed the planet from the summit of a mountain in
Arizona,<br>
using an 18-inch refracting telescope and every resource of<br>
delicate measurement and spectroscopy. So superb a climate<br>
favoured them that for ten months the planet was kept under<br>
continual observation. Over 900 drawings were made and not
only<br>
were Schiaparelli's channels confirmed, but they added 116 to
his<br>
79, on that portion of the planet visible at that opposition.<br>
They made the further important discovery that the lines do
not<br>
stop short at the dark regions of the planet's surface, as<br>
hitherto believed, but go right on in many cases; the
curvature<br>
of the lines being unaltered.</p>
<p>Lowell is an uncompromising advocate of the "canal" theory.
If<br>
his arguments are correct we have at once an answer to our<br>
question, "Are there other minds than ours?"</p>
<p>We must consider a moment Lowell's arguments; not that it is
my<br>
intention to combat them. You must form your own conclusions.
I<br>
shall lay before you another and, as I venture to think, more<br>
adequate hypothesis in explanation of the channels of<br>
Schiaparelli. We learn, however, much from Lowell's book&mdash;it
is<br>
full of interest.[1]</p>
<p>Lowell lays a deep foundation. He begins by showing that Mars
has<br>
an atmosphere. This must be granted him till some counter<br>
observations are made.</p>
<p>[1] _Mars_, by Percival Lowell (Longmans, Green &amp; Co.),
1896,</p>
<p>168</p>
<p>It is generally accepted. What that atmosphere is, is
another<br>
matter. He certainly has made out a good case for the presence
of<br>
water as one of its constituents,</p>
<p>It was long known that Mars possessed white regions at his
poles,<br>
just as our Earth does. The waning of these polar snows&mdash;if
indeed<br>
they are such&mdash;with the advance of the Martian summer, had
often<br>
been observed. Lowell plots day by day this waning. It is
evident<br>
from his observations that the snowfall must be light indeed.
We<br>
see in his map the south pole turned towards us. Mars in<br>
perihelion always turns his south pole towards the sun and<br>
therefore towards the Earth. We see that between the dates
June<br>
3rd to August 3rd&mdash;or in two months&mdash;the polar snow had
almost<br>
completely vanished. This denotes a very scanty covering. It
must<br>
be remembered that Mars even when nearest to the sun receives
but<br>
half our supply of solar heat and light.</p>
<p>But other evidence exists to show that Mars probably
possesses<br>
but little water upon his surface. The dark places are not<br>
water-covered, although they have been named as if they were,<br>
indeed, seas and lakes. Various phenomena show this. The
canals<br>
show it. It would never do to imagine canals crossing the
seas.<br>
No great rivers are visible. There is a striking absence of<br>
clouds. The atmosphere of Mars seems as serene as that of
Venus<br>
appears to be cloudy. Mists and clouds, however, sometime
appear<br>
to veil his face and add to the difficulty of</p>
<p>169</p>
<p>making observations near the limb of the planet. Lowell
concludes<br>
it must be a calm and serene atmosphere; probably only<br>
one-seventh of our own in density. The normal height of the<br>
barometer in Mars would then be but four and a half inches.
This<br>
is a pressure far less than exists on the top of the highest<br>
terrestrial mountain. A mountain here must have an altitude
of<br>
about ten miles to possess so low a pressure on its summit.
Drops<br>
of water big enough to form rain can hardly collect in such a<br>
rarefied atmosphere. Moisture will fall as dew or frost upon
the<br>
ground. The days will be hot owing to the unimpeded solar<br>
radiation; the nights bitterly cold owing to the free
radiation<br>
into space.</p>
<p>We may add that in such a climate the frost will descend<br>
principally upon the high ground at night time and in the<br>
advancing day it will melt. The freer radiation brings about
this<br>
phenomenon among our own mountains in clear and calm weather.</p>
<p>With the progressive melting of the snow upon the pole
Lowell<br>
connected many phenomena upon the planet's surface of much<br>
interest. The dark spaces appear to grow darker and more<br>
greenish. The canals begin to show themselves and reveal
their<br>
double nature. All this suggests that the moisture liberated
by<br>
the melting of the polar snow with the advancing year, is<br>
carrying vitality and springtime over the surface of the
planet.<br>
But how is the water conveyed?</p>
<p>Lowell believes principally by the canals. These are</p>
<p>170</p>
<p>constructed triangulating the surface of the planet in all<br>
directions. What we see, according to Lowell, is not the
canal<br>
itself, but the broad band of vegetation which springs up on
the<br>
arrival of the water. This band is perhaps thirty or forty
miles<br>
wide, but perhaps much less, for Lowell reports that the
better<br>
the conditions of observation the finer the lines appeared,
so<br>
that they may be as narrow, possibly, as fifteen miles. It is
to<br>
be remarked that a just visible dot on the surface of Mars
must<br>
possess a diameter of 30 miles. But a chain of much smaller
dots<br>
will be visible, just as we can see such fine objects as
spiders'<br>
webs. The widening of the canals is then accounted for,
according<br>
to Lowell, by the growth of a band of vegetation, similar to
that<br>
which springs into existence when the floods of the Nile
irrigate<br>
the plains of Egypt.</p>
<p>If no other explanation of the lines is forthcoming than
that<br>
they are the work of intelligence, all this must be
remembered.<br>
If all other theories fail us, much must be granted Lowell.
We<br>
must not reason like fishes&mdash;as Lowell puts it&mdash;and
deny that<br>
intelligent beings can thrive in an atmospheric pressure of
four<br>
and half inches of mercury. Zurbriggen has recently got to
the<br>
top of Aconcagua, a height of 24,000 feet. On the summit of
such<br>
a mountain the barometer must stand at about ten inches. Why<br>
should not beings be developed by evolution with a lung
capacity<br>
capable of living at two and a half times this altitude.
Those<br>
steadily</p>
<p>171</p>
<p>curved parallel lines are, indeed, very unlike anything we
have<br>
experience of. It would be rather to be expected that another<br>
civilisation than our own would present many wide differences
in<br>
its development.</p>
<p>What then is the picture we have before us according to
Lowell?<br>
It is a sufficiently dramatic one.</p>
<p>Mars is a world whose water supply, never probably very
abundant,<br>
has through countless years been drying up, sinking into his<br>
surface. But the inhabitants are making a brave fight for it,<br>
They have constructed canals right round their world so that
the<br>
water, which otherwise would run to waste over the vast
deserts,<br>
is led from oasis to oasis. Here the great centres of<br>
civilisation are placed: their Londons, Viennas, New Yorks.
These<br>
gigantic works are the works of despair. A great and
civilised<br>
world finds death staring it in the face. They have had to
triple<br>
their canals so that when the central canal has done its work
the<br>
water is turned into the side canals, in order to utilise it
as<br>
far as possible. Through their splendid telescopes they must
view<br>
our seas and ample rivers; and must die like travellers in
the<br>
desert seeing in a mirage the cool waters of a distant lake.</p>
<p>Perhaps that lonely signal reported to have been seen in
the<br>
twilight limb of Mars was the outcome of pride in their
splendid<br>
and perishing civilisation. They would leave some memory of
it:<br>
they would have us witness how great was that civilisation
before<br>
they perish!</p>
<p>I close this dramatic picture with the poor comfort</p>
<p>172</p>
<p>that several philanthropic people have suggested signalling
to<br>
them as a mark of sympathy. It is said that a fortune was<br>
bequeathed to the French Academy for the purpose of
communicating<br>
with the Martians. It has been suggested that we could flash<br>
signals to them by means of gigantic mirrors reflecting the
light<br>
of our Sun. Or, again, that we might light bonfires on a<br>
sufficiently large scale. They would have to be about ten
miles<br>
in diameter! A writer in the Pall Mall Gazette suggested that<br>
there need really be no difficulty in the matter. With the
kind<br>
cooperation of the London Gas Companies (this was before the
days<br>
of electric lighting) a signal might be sent without any<br>
additional expense if the gas companies would consent to<br>
simultaneously turn off the gas at intervals of five minutes
over<br>
the whole of London, a signal which would be visible to the<br>
astronomers in Mars would result. He adds, naively: "If only<br>
tried for an hour each night some results might be obtained."</p>
<p>II</p>
<p>We have reviewed the theory of the artificial construction of
the<br>
Martian lines. The amount of consideration we are disposed to<br>
give to the supposition that there are upon Mars other minds
than<br>
ours will&mdash;as I have stated&mdash;necessarily depend upon
whether or not<br>
we can assign a probable explanation of the lines upon purely<br>
physical grounds. If it is apparent that such</p>
<p>173</p>
<p>lines would be formed with great probability under certain<br>
conditions, which conditions are themselves probable, then
the<br>
argument by exclusion for the existence of civilisation on
Mars,<br>
at once breaks down.</p>
<p>{Fig. 10}</p>
<p>As a romance writer is sometimes under the necessity of<br>
transporting his readers to other scenes, so I must now ask
you<br>
to consent to be transported some millions</p>
<p>174</p>
<p>of miles into the region of the heavens which lies outside
Mars'<br>
orbit.</p>
<p>Between Mars and Jupiter is a chasm of 341 millions of
miles.<br>
This gap in the sequence of planets was long known to be
quite<br>
out of keeping with the orderly succession of worlds outward
from<br>
the Sun. A society was formed at the close of the last
century<br>
for the detection of the missing world. On the first day of
the<br>
last century, Piazzi&mdash;who, by the way, was not a member of
the<br>
society&mdash;discovered a tiny world in the vacant gap.
Although<br>
eagerly welcomed, as better than nothing, it was a
disappointing<br>
find. The new world was a mere rock. A speck of about 160
miles<br>
in diameter. It was obviously never intended that such a body<br>
should have all this space to itself. And, sure enough,
shortly<br>
after, another small world was discovered. Then another was<br>
found, and another, and so on; and now more than 400 of these<br>
strange little worlds are known.</p>
<p>But whence came such bodies? The generally accepted belief
is<br>
that these really represent a misbegotten world. When the Sun
was<br>
younger he shed off the several worlds of our system as so
many<br>
rings. Each ring then coalesced into a world. Neptune being
the<br>
first born; Mercury the youngest born.</p>
<p>After Jupiter was thrown off, and the Sun had shrunk away
inwards<br>
some 20o million miles, he shed off another ring. Meaning
that<br>
this offspring of his should grow up like the rest, develop
into<br>
a stable world with the</p>
<p>175</p>
<p>potentiality even, it may be, of becoming the abode of
rational<br>
beings. But something went wrong. It broke up into a ring of<br>
little bodies, circulating around him.</p>
<p>It is probable on this hypothesis that the number we are<br>
acquainted with does not nearly represent the actual number
of<br>
past and present asteroids. It would take 125,000 of the
biggest<br>
of them to make up a globe as big as our world. They, so far
as<br>
they are known, vary in size from 10 miles to 160 miles in<br>
diameter. It is probable then&mdash;on the assumption that this
failure<br>
of a world was intended to be about the mass of our
Earth&mdash;that<br>
they numbered, and possibly number, many hundreds of
thousands.</p>
<p>Some of these little bodies are very peculiar in respect to
the<br>
orbits they move in. This peculiarity is sometimes in the<br>
eccentricity of their orbits, sometimes in the manner in
which<br>
their orbits are tilted to the general plane of the ecliptic,
in<br>
which all the other planets move.</p>
<p>The eccentricity, according to Proctor, in some cases may
attain<br>
such extremes as to bring the little world inside Mars' mean<br>
distance from the sun. This, as you will remember, is very
much<br>
less than his greatest distance from the sun. The entire belt
of<br>
asteroids&mdash;as known&mdash;lie much nearer to Mars than to
Jupiter.</p>
<p>As regards the tilt of their orbits, some are actually as much
as<br>
34 degrees inclined to the ecliptic, so that in fact they are<br>
seen from the Earth among our polar constellations.</p>
<p>176</p>
<p>From all this you see that Mars occupies a rather hot comer
in<br>
the solar system. Is it not possible that more than once in
the<br>
remote past Mars may have encountered one of these wanderers?
If<br>
he came within a certain distance of the small body his great<br>
mass would sway it from its orbit, and under certain
conditions<br>
he would pick up a satellite in this manner. That his present<br>
satellites were actually so acquired is the suggestion of
Newton,<br>
of Yale College.</p>
<p>Mars' satellites are indeed suspiciously and most
abnormally<br>
small. I have not time to prove this to you by comparison
with<br>
the other worlds of the solar system. In fact, they were not<br>
discovered till 1877&mdash;although they were predicted in a
most<br>
curious manner, with the most uncannily accurate details, by<br>
Swift.</p>
<p>One of these bodies is about 36 miles in diameter. This is<br>
Phobos. Phobos is only 3.700 miles from the surface of Mars.
The<br>
other is smaller and further off. He is named Deimos, and his<br>
diameter is only 10 miles. He is 12,500 miles from Mars'
surface.<br>
With the exception of Phobos the next smallest satellite known
in<br>
the solar system is one of Saturn's&mdash;Hyperion; almost 800
miles in<br>
diameter. The inner one goes all round Mars in 7&frac12; hours.
This is<br>
Phobos' month. Mars turns on his axis in 24 hours and 40
minutes,<br>
so that people in Mars would see the rise of Phobos twice in
the<br>
course of a day and night; lie would apparently cross the sky</p>
<p>177</p>
<p>going against the other satellite; that is, he would move<br>
apparently from west to east.</p>
<p>We may at least assume as probable that other satellites
have<br>
been gathered by Mars in the past from the army of asteroids.</p>
<p>Some of the satellites so picked up would be direct: that
is,<br>
would move round the planet in the direction of his axial<br>
rotation. Others, on the chances, would be retrograde: that
is,<br>
would move against his axial rotation. They would describe
orbits<br>
making the same various angles with the ecliptic as do the<br>
asteroids; and we may be sure they would be of the same
varying<br>
dimensions.</p>
<p>We go on to inquire what would be the consequence to Mars of
such<br>
captures.</p>
<p>A satellite captured in this manner is very likely to be
pulled<br>
into the Planet. This is a probable end of a satellite in any<br>
case. It will probably be the end of our satellite too. The<br>
satellite Phobos is indeed believed to be about to take this
very<br>
plunge into his planet. But in the case when the satellite
picked<br>
up happens to be rotating round the planet in the opposite<br>
direction to the axial rotation of the planet, it is pretty<br>
certain that its career as a satellite will be a brief one.
The<br>
reasons for this I cannot now give. If, then, Mars picked up<br>
satellites he is very sure to have absorbed them sooner or
later.<br>
Sooner if they happened to be retrograde satellites, later if<br>
direct satellites. His present satellites are recent
additions.<br>
They are direct.</p>
<p>178</p>
<p>The path of an expiring satellite will be a slow spiral
described<br>
round the planet. The spiral will at last, after many years,<br>
bring the satellite down upon the surface of the primary. Its<br>
final approach will be accelerated if the planet possesses an<br>
atmosphere, as Mars probably does. A satellite of the
dimensions<br>
of Phobos&mdash;that is 36 miles in diameter&mdash;would hardly
survive more<br>
than 30 to 60 years within seventy miles of Mars' surface. It<br>
will then be rotating round Mars in an hour and forty
minutes,<br>
moving, in fact, at the rate of 2.2 miles per second. In the<br>
course of this 30 or 60 years it will, therefore, get round<br>
perhaps 200,000 times, before it finally crashes down upon
the<br>
Martians. During this closing history of the satellite there
is<br>
reason to believe, however, that it would by no means pursue<br>
continually the same path over the surface of the planet.
There<br>
are many disturbing factors to be considered. Being so small
any<br>
large surface features of Mars would probably act to perturb
the<br>
orbit of the satellite.</p>
<p>The explanation of Mars' lines which I suggest, is that they
were<br>
formed by the approach of such satellites in former times. I
do<br>
not mean that they are lines cut into his surface by the
actual<br>
infall of a satellite. The final end of the satellite would
be<br>
too rapid for this, I think. But I hope to be able to show
you<br>
that there is reason to believe that the mere passage of the<br>
satellite, say at 70 miles above the surface of the planet,
will,<br>
in itself, give rise to effects on the crust of the planet<br>
capable</p>
<p>179</p>
<p>of accounting for just such single or parallel lines as we
see.</p>
<p>In the first place we have to consider the stability of
the<br>
satellite. Even in the case of a small satellite we cannot<br>
overlook the fact that the half of the satellite near the
planet<br>
is pulled towards the planet by a gravitational force greater<br>
than that attracting the outer half, and that the centrifugal<br>
force is less on the inner than on the outer hemisphere.
Hence<br>
there exists a force tending to tear the satellite asunder on
the<br>
equatorial section tangential</p>
<p>{Fig. 11}</p>
<p>to the planet's surface. If in a fluid or plastic state,
Phobos,<br>
for instance, could not possibly exist near the planet's
surface.<br>
The forces referred to would decide its fate. It may be shown
by<br>
calculation, however, that if Phobos has the strength of
basalt<br>
or glass there would remain a considerable coefficient of
safety<br>
in favour of the satellite's stability; even when the surfaces
of<br>
planet and satellite were separated by only five miles.</p>
<p>We have now to consider some things which we expect will
happen<br>
before the satellite takes its final plunge into the planet.</p>
<p>180</p>
<p>This diagram (Fig. 11) shows you the satellite travelling
above<br>
the surface of the planet. The satellite is advancing towards,
or<br>
away from, the spectator. The planet is supposed to show its<br>
solid crust in cross section, which may be a few miles in<br>
thickness. Below this is such a hot plastic magma as we have<br>
reason to believe underlies much of the solid crust of our
own<br>
Earth. Now there is an attraction between the satellite and
the<br>
crust of the planet; the same gravitational attraction which<br>
exists between every particle of matter in the universe. Let
us<br>
consider how this attraction will affect the planet's crust.
I<br>
have drawn little arrows to show how we may consider the<br>
attraction of the satellite pulling the crust of the planet
not<br>
only upwards, but also pulling it inwards beneath the
satellite.<br>
I have made these arrows longer where calculation shows the<br>
stress is greater. You see that the greatest lifting stress
is<br>
just beneath the satellite, whereas the greatest stress
pulling<br>
the crust in under the satellite is at a point which lies out<br>
from under the satellite, at a considerable distance. At each<br>
side of the satellite there is a point where the stress
pulling<br>
on the crust is the greatest. Of the two stresses the lifting<br>
stress will tend to raise the crust a little; the pulling
stress<br>
may in certain cases actually tear the crust across; as at A
and<br>
B.</p>
<p>It is possible to calculate the amount of the stress at the
point<br>
at each side of the satellite where the stress is at its<br>
greatest. We must assume the satellite to be a certain size
and<br>
density; we must also assume the crust of</p>
<p>181</p>
<p>Mars to be of some certain density. To fix our ideas on
these<br>
points I take the case of the present satellite Phobos. What<br>
amount of stress will he exert upon the crust of Mars when he<br>
approaches within, say, 40 miles of the planet's surface? We
know<br>
his size approximately&mdash;he is about 36 miles in diameter. We
can<br>
guess his density to be between four times that of water and<br>
eight times that of water. We may assume the density of Mars'<br>
surface to be about the same as that of our Earth's surface,
that<br>
is three times as dense as water. We now find that the
greatest<br>
stress tending to rend open the surface crust of Mars will be<br>
between 4,000 and 8,000 pounds to the square foot according
to<br>
the density we assign to Phobos.</p>
<p>Will such a stress actually tear open the crust? We are not
able<br>
to answer this question with any certainty. Much will depend
upon<br>
the nature and condition of the crust. Thus, suppose that we
are<br>
here (Fig. 12) looking down upon the satellite which is
moving<br>
along slowly relatively to Mars' surface, in the direction of
the<br>
arrow. The satellite has just passed over a weak and cracked
part<br>
of the planet's crust. Here the stress has been sufficient to<br>
start two cracks. Now you know how easy it is to tear a piece
of<br>
cloth when you go to the edge of it in order to make a
beginning.<br>
Here the stress from the satellite has got to the edge of the<br>
crust. It is greatly concentrated just at the extremities of
the<br>
cracks. It will, unler such circumstances probably carry on
the</p>
<p>182</p>
<p>tear. If it does not do so this time, remember the satellite
will<br>
some hours later be coming over the same place again, and
then<br>
again for, at least, many hundreds of times. Then also we are
not<br>
limited to the assumption that the</p>
<p>{Fig. 12}</p>
<p>satellite is as small as Phobos. Suppose we consider the case
of<br>
a satellite approaching Mars which has a diameter double that
of<br>
Phobos; a diameter still much less than that of the larger
class<br>
of asteroids. Even at the distance</p>
<p>183</p>
<p>of 65 miles the stress will now amount to as much as from 15
to<br>
30 tons per square foot. It is almost certain that such a
stress<br>
repeated a comparatively few times over the same parts of the<br>
planet's surface would so rend the crust as to set up lines
along<br>
which plutonic action would find a vent. That is, we might
expect<br>
along these lines all the phenomena of upheaval and volcanic<br>
eruption which give rise to surface elevations.</p>
<p>The probable effect of a satellite of this dimension
travelling<br>
slowly relatively to the surface of Mars is, then, to leave a<br>
very conspicuous memorial of his presence behind him. You see<br>
from the diagram that this memorial will consist o: two
parallel<br>
lines of disturbance.</p>
<p>The linear character of the gravitational effects of the<br>
satellite is due entirely to the motion of the satellite<br>
relatively to the surface of the planet. If the satellite
stood<br>
still above the surface the gravitational stress in the crust<br>
would, of course, be exerted radially outwards from the centre
of<br>
the satellite. It would attain at the central point beneath
the<br>
satellite its maximum vertical effect, and at some radial<br>
distance measured outwards from this point, which distance we
can<br>
calculate, its maximum horizontal tearing effect. When the<br>
satellite moves relatively to the planet's crust, the
horizontal<br>
tearing force acts differently according to whether it is<br>
directed in the line of motion or at right angles to this
line.</p>
<p>In the direction of motion we see that the satellite</p>
<p>184</p>
<p>creates as it passes over the crust a wave of rarefaction
or<br>
tension as at D, followed by compression just beneath the<br>
satellite and by a reversed direction of gravitational pull
as<br>
the satellite passes onwards. These stresses rapidly replace
one<br>
another as the satellite travels along. They are resisted by
the<br>
inertia of the crust, and are taken up by its elasticity. The<br>
nature of this succession of alternate compressions and<br>
rarefactions in the crust possess some resemblance to those<br>
arising in an earthquake shock.</p>
<p>If we consider the effects taking place laterally to the line
of<br>
motion we see that there are no such changes in the nature of
the<br>
forces in the crust. At each passage of the satellite the<br>
horizontal tearing stress increases to a maximum, when it is<br>
exerted laterally, along the line passing through the
horizontal<br>
projection of the satellite and at right angles to the line
of<br>
motion, and again dies away. It is always a tearing stress,<br>
renewed again and again.</p>
<p>This effect is at its maximum along two particular parallel
lines<br>
which are tangents to the circle of maximum horizontal stress
and<br>
which run parallel with the path of the satellite. The
distance<br>
separating these lines depend upon the elevation of the
satellite<br>
above the planet's surface. Such lines mark out the
theoretical<br>
axes of the "double canals" which future crustal movements
will<br>
more fully develop.</p>
<p>It is interesting to consider what the effect of such</p>
<p>185</p>
<p>conditions would be if they arose at the surface of our
own<br>
planet. We assume a horizontal force in the crust adequate to
set<br>
up tensile stresses of the order, say, of fifteen tons to the<br>
square foot and these stresses to be repeated every few
hours;<br>
our world being also subject to the dynamic effects we
recognise<br>
in and beneath its crust.</p>
<p>It is easy to see that the areas over which the satellite
exerted<br>
its gravitational stresses must become the foci &mdash;foci of
linear<br>
form&mdash;of tectonic developments or crust movements. The
relief of<br>
stresses, from whatever cause arising, in and beneath the
crust<br>
must surely take place in these regions of disturbance and
along<br>
these linear areas. Here must become concentrated the folding<br>
movements, which are under existing conditions brought into
the<br>
geosynclines, along with their attendant volcanic phenomena.
In<br>
the case of Mars such a concentration of tectonic events
would<br>
not, owing to the absence of extensive subaerial denudation
and<br>
great oceans, be complicated by the existence of such
synclinal<br>
accumulations as have controlled terrestrial surface
development.<br>
With the passage of time the linear features would probably<br>
develop; the energetic substratum continually asserting its<br>
influence along such lines of weakness. It is in the highest<br>
degree probable that radioactivity plays no less a part in<br>
Martian history than in terrestrial. The fact of radioactive<br>
heating allows us to assume the thin surface crust and
continued<br>
sub-crustal energy throughout the entire period of the
planet's<br>
history.</p>
<p>186</p>
<p>How far willl these effects resemble the double canals of
Mars?<br>
In this figure and in the calculations I have given you I
have<br>
supposed the satellite engaged in marking the planet's
surface<br>
with two lines separated by about the interval separating the<br>
wider double canals of Mars&mdash;that is about 220 miles apart.
What<br>
the distance between the lines will be, as already stated,
will<br>
depend upon the height of the satellite above the surface when
it<br>
comes upon a part of the crust in a condition to be affected
by<br>
the stresses it sets up in it. If the satellite does its work
at<br>
a point lower down above the surface the canal produced will
be<br>
narrower. The stresses, too, will then be much greater. I
must<br>
also observe that once the crust has yielded to the pulling<br>
stress, there is great probability that in future revolutions
of<br>
the satellite a central fracture will result. For then all
the<br>
pulling force adds itself to the lifting force and tends to
crush<br>
the crust inwards on the central line beneath the satellite.
It<br>
is thus quite possible that the passage of a satellite may
give<br>
rise to triple lines. There is reason to believe that the
canals<br>
on Mars are in some cases triple.</p>
<p>I have spoken all along of the satellite moving slowly over
the<br>
surface of Mars. I have done so as I cannot at all pronounce
so<br>
readily on what will happen when the satellite's velocity
over<br>
the surface of Mars is very great. To account for all the
lines<br>
mapped by Lowell some of them must have been produced by<br>
satellities moving relatively to the surface of Mars at<br>
velocities so great</p>
<p>187</p>
<p>as three miles a second or even rather more. The stresses set
up<br>
are, in such cases, very difficult to estimate. It has not
yet<br>
been done. Parallel lines of greatest stress or impulse ought
to<br>
be formed as in the other case.</p>
<p>I now ask your attention to another kind of evidence that
the<br>
lines are due in some way to the motion of satellites passing<br>
over the surface of Mars.</p>
<p>I may put the fresh evidence to which I refer, in this way:
In<br>
Lowell's map (P1. XXII, p. 192), and in a less degree in<br>
Schiaparelli's map (ante p. 166), we are given the course of
the<br>
lines as fragments of incomplete curves. Now these curves
might<br>
have been anything at all. We must take them as they are,<br>
however, when we apply them as a test of the theory that the<br>
motion of a satellite round Mars can strike such lines. If it
can<br>
be shown that satellites revolving round Mars might strike
just<br>
such curves then we assume this as an added confirmation of
the<br>
hypothesis.</p>
<p>We must begin by realising what sort of curves a satellite
which<br>
disturbs the surface of a planet would leave behind it after
its<br>
demise. You might think that the satellite revolving round
and<br>
round the planet must simply describe a circle upon the
spherical<br>
surface of the planet: a "great circle" as it is called; that
is<br>
the greatest circle which can be described upon a sphere.
This<br>
great circle can, however, only be struck, as you will see,
when<br>
the planet is not turning upon its axis: a condition not
likely<br>
to be realised.</p>
<p>This diagram (PI. XXI) shows the surface of a globe</p>
<p>188</p>
<p>covered with the usual imaginary lines of latitude and
longitude.<br>
The orbit of a supposed satellite is shown by a line crossing
the<br>
sphere at some assumed angle with the equator. Along this
line<br>
the satellite always moves at uniform velocity, passing
across<br>
and round the back of the sphere and again across. If the
sphere<br>
is not turning on its polar axis then this satellite, which
we<br>
will suppose armed with a pencil which draws a line upon the<br>
sphere, will strike a great circle right round the sphere.
But<br>
the sphere is rotating. And it is to be expected that at<br>
different times in a planet's history the rate of rotation
varies<br>
very much indeed. There is reason to believe that our own day
was<br>
once only 2&frac12; hours long, or thereabouts. After a
preliminary rise<br>
in velocity of axial rotation, due to shrinkage attending
rapid<br>
cooling, a planet as it advances in years rotates slower and<br>
slower. This phenomenon is due to tidal influences of the sun
or<br>
of satellites. On the assumption that satellites fell into
Mars<br>
there would in his case be a further action tending to
shorten<br>
his day as time went on.</p>
<p>The effect of the rotation of the planet will be, of course,
that<br>
as the satellite advances with its pencil it finds the surface
of<br>
the sphere being displaced from under it. The line struck
ceases<br>
to be the great circle but wanders off in another
curve&mdash;which is<br>
in fact not a circle at all.</p>
<p>You will readily see how we find this curve. Suppose the
sphere<br>
to be rotating at such a speed that while the satellite is<br>
advancing the distance _Oa_, the point _b_ on the</p>
<p>189</p>
<p>sphere will be carried into the path of the satellite. The
pencil<br>
will mark this point. Similarly we find that all the points
along<br>
this full curved line are points which will just find
themselves<br>
under the satellite as it passes with its pencil. This curve
is<br>
then the track marked out by the revolving satellite. You see
it<br>
dotted round the back of the sphere to where it cuts the
equator<br>
at a certain point. The course of the curve and the point
where<br>
it cuts the equator, before proceeding on its way, entirely<br>
depend upon the rate at which we suppose the sphere to be<br>
rotating and the satellite to be describing the orbit. We may<br>
call the distance measured round the planet's equator
separating<br>
the starting point of the curve from the point at which it
again<br>
meets the equator, the "span" of the curve. The span then
depends<br>
entirely upon the rate of rotation of the planet on its axis
and<br>
of the satellite in its orbit round the planet.</p>
<p>But the nature of events might have been somewhat different.
The<br>
satellite is, in the figure, supposed to be rotating round
the<br>
sphere in the same direction as that in which the sphere is<br>
turning. It might have been that Mars had picked up a
satellite<br>
travelling in the opposite direction to that in which he was<br>
turning. With the velocity of planet on its axis and of
satellite<br>
in its orbit the same as before, a different curve would have<br>
been described. The span of the curve due to a retrograde<br>
satellite will be greater than that due to a direct
satellite.<br>
The retrograde satellite will have a span more than half</p>
<p>190</p>
<p>way round the planet, the direct satellite will describe a
curve<br>
which will be less than half way round the planet: that is a
span<br>
due to a retrograde satellite will be more than 180 degrees,<br>
while the span due to a direct satellite will be less than
180<br>
degrees upon the planet's equator.</p>
<p>I would draw your attention to the fact that what the span
will<br>
be does not depend upon how much the orbit of the satellite
is<br>
inclined to the equator. This only decides how far the curve<br>
marked out by the satellite will recede from the equator.</p>
<p>We find then, so far, that it is easy to distinguish between
the<br>
direct and the retrograde curves. The span of one is less, of
the<br>
other greater, than 180 degrees. The number of degrees which<br>
either sort of curve subtends upon the equator entirely
depends<br>
upon the velocity of the satellite and the axial velocity of
the<br>
planet.</p>
<p>But of these two velocities that of the satellite may be taken
as<br>
sensibly invariable, when close enough to use his pencil.
This<br>
depends upon the law of centrifugal force, which teaches us
that<br>
the mass of the planet alone decides the velocity of a
satellite<br>
in its orbit at any fixed distance from the planet's centre.
The<br>
other velocity&mdash;that of the planet upon its axis&mdash;was,
as we have<br>
seen, not in the past what it is now. If then Mars, at
various<br>
times in his past history, picked up satellites, these
satellites<br>
will describe curves round him having different spans which
will<br>
depend upon the velocity of axial rotation of Mars at the
time<br>
and upon this only.</p>
<p>191</p>
<p>In what way now can we apply this knowledge of the curves<br>
described by a satellite as a test of the lunar origin of the<br>
lines on Mars?</p>
<p>To do this we must apply to Lowell's map. We pick out
preferably,<br>
of course, the most complete and definite curves. The chain
of<br>
canals of which Acheron and Erebus are members mark out a
fairly<br>
definite curve. We produce it by eye, preserving the curvature
as<br>
far as possible, till it cuts the equator. Reading the span
on<br>
the equator we find' it to be 255 degrees. In the first place
we<br>
say then that this curve is due to a retrograde satellite. We<br>
also note on Lowell's map that the greatest rise of the curve
is<br>
to a point about 32 degrees north of the equator. This gives
the<br>
inclination of the satellite's orbit to the plane of Mars'<br>
equator.</p>
<p>With these data we calculate the velocity which the planet
must<br>
have possessed at the time the canal was formed on the
hypothesis<br>
that the curve was indeed the work of a satellite. The final<br>
question now remains If we determine the curve due to this<br>
velocity of Mars on its axis, will this curve fit that one
which<br>
appears on Lowell's map, and of which we have really availed<br>
ourselves of only three points? To answer this question we
plot<br>
upon a sphere, the curve of a satellite, in the manner I have<br>
described, assigning to this sphere the velocity derived from
the<br>
span of 255 degrees. Having plotted the curve on the sphere
it<br>
only remains to transfer it to Lowell's map. This is easily<br>
done.</p>
<p>192</p>
<p>This map (Pl. XXII) shows you the result of treating this,
as<br>
well as other curves, in the manner just described. You see
that<br>
whether the fragmentary curves are steep and receding far
from<br>
the equator; or whether they are flat and lying close along
the<br>
equator; whether they span less or more than 180 degrees; the<br>
curves determined on the supposition that they are the work
of<br>
satellites revolving round Mars agree with the mapped curves;<br>
following them with wonderful accuracy; possessing their<br>
properties, and, indeed, in some cases, actually coinciding
with<br>
them.</p>
<p>I may add that the inadmissible span of 180 degrees and
spans<br>
very near this value, which are not well admissible, are so
far<br>
as I can find, absent. The curves are not great circles.</p>
<p>You will require of me that I should explain the centres
of<br>
radiation so conspicuous here and there on Lowell's map. The<br>
meeting of more than two lines at the oases is a phenomenon<br>
possibly of the same nature and also requiring explanation.</p>
<p>In the first place the curves to which I have but briefly<br>
referred actually give rise in most cases to nodal, or
crossing<br>
points; sometimes on the equator, sometimes off the equator;<br>
through which the path of the satellite returns again and
again.<br>
These nodal points will not, however, afford a general<br>
explanation of the many-branched radiants.</p>
<p>It is probable that we should refer such an appearance</p>
<p>193</p>
<p>as is shown at the Sinus Titanum to the perturbations of
the<br>
satellite's path due to the surface features on Mars. Observe<br>
that the principal radiants are situated upon the boundary of
the<br>
dark regions or at the oases. Higher surface levels may be<br>
involved in both cases. Some marked difference in topography
must<br>
characterise both these features. The latter may possibly<br>
originate in the destruction of satellites. Or again, they
may<br>
arise in crustal disturbance of a volcanic nature, primarily<br>
induced or localised by the crossing of two canals. Whatever
the<br>
origin of these features it is only necessary to assume that
they<br>
represent elevated features of some magnitude to explain the<br>
multiplication of crossing lines. We must here recall what<br>
observers say of the multiplicity of the canals. According to<br>
Lowell, "What their number maybe lies quite beyond the<br>
possibility of count at present; for the better our own air,
the<br>
more of them are visible."</p>
<p>Such innumerable canals are just what the present theory<br>
requires. An in-falling satellite will, in the course of the
last<br>
60 or 80 years of its career, circulate some 100,000 times
over<br>
Mars' surface. Now what will determine the more conspicuous<br>
development of a particular canal? The mass of the satellite;
the<br>
state of the surface crust; the proximity of the satellite;
and<br>
the amount of repetition over the same ground. The after
effects<br>
may be taken as proportional to the primary disturbance.</p>
<p>194</p>
<p>It is probable that elevated surface features will influence
two<br>
of these conditions: the number of repetitions and the
proximity<br>
to the surface. A tract 100 miles in diameter and elevated
5,000<br>
or 10,000 feet would seriously perturb the orbit of such a body
as<br>
Phobos. It is to be expected that not only would it be
effective<br>
in swaying the orbit of the satellite in the horizontal
direction<br>
but also would draw it down closer to the surface. It is even
to<br>
be considered if such a mass might not become nodal to the<br>
satellite's orbit, so that this passed through or above this<br>
point at various inclinations with its primary direction. If<br>
acting to bring down the orbit then this will quicken the
speed<br>
and cause the satellite further on its path to attain a
somewhat<br>
higher elevation above the surface. The lines most conspicuous
in<br>
the telescope are, in short, those which have been favoured by
a<br>
combination of circumstances as reviewed above, among which<br>
crustal features have, in some cases, played a part.</p>
<p>I must briefly refer to what is one of the most
interesting<br>
features of the Martian lines: the manner in which they appear
to<br>
come and go like visions.</p>
<p>Something going on in Mars determines the phenomenon. On a<br>
particular night a certain line looks single. A few nights
later<br>
signs of doubling are perceived, and later still, when the
seeing<br>
is particularly good, not one but two lines are seen. Thus, as
an<br>
example, we may take the case of Phison and Euphrates. Faint<br>
glimpses of the dual state were detected in the summer</p>
<p>195</p>
<p>and autumn, but not till November did they appear as
distinctly<br>
double. Observe that by this time the Antarctic snows had
melted,<br>
and there was in addition, sufficient time for the moisture
so<br>
liberated to become diffused in the planet's atmosphere.</p>
<p>This increase in the definition and conspicuousness of
certain<br>
details on Mars' surface is further brought into connection
with<br>
the liberation of the polar snows and the diffusion of this
water<br>
through the atmosphere, by the fact that the definition
appeared<br>
progressively better from the south pole upwards as the snow<br>
disappeared. Lowell thinks this points to vegetation springing
up<br>
under the influence of moisture; he considers, however, as we<br>
have seen, that the canals convey the moisture. He has to
assume<br>
the construction of triple canals to explain the doubling of
the<br>
lines.</p>
<p>If we once admit the canals to be elevated ranges&mdash;not
necessarily<br>
of great height&mdash;the difficulty of accounting for
increased<br>
definition with increase of moisture vanishes. We need not<br>
necessarily even suppose vegetation concerned. With respect
to<br>
this last possibility we may remark that the colour
observations,<br>
upon which the idea of vegetation is based, are likely to be<br>
uncertain owing to possible fatigue effects where a dark
object<br>
is seen against a reddish background.</p>
<p>However this may be we have to consider what the effects
of<br>
moisture increasing in the atmosphere of Mars will be with
regard<br>
to the visibility of elevated ranges,</p>
<p>196</p>
<p>We assume a serene and rare atmosphere: the nights
intensely<br>
cold, the days hot with the unveiled solar radiation. On the
hill<br>
tops the cold of night will be still more intense and so,
also,<br>
will the solar radiation by day. The result of this state of<br>
things will be that the moisture will be precipitated mainly
on<br>
the mountains during the cold of night&mdash;in the form of
frost&mdash;and<br>
during the day this covering of frost will melt; and, just as
we<br>
see a heavy dew-fall darken the ground in summer, so the
melting<br>
ice will set off the elevated land against the arid plains
below.<br>
Our valleys are more moist than our mountains only because
our<br>
moisture is so abundant that it drains off the mountains into
the<br>
valleys. If moisture was scarce it would distil from the
plains<br>
to the colder elevations of the hills. On this view the<br>
accentuation of a canal is the result of meteorological
effects<br>
such as would arise in the Martian climate; effects which must
be<br>
influenced by conditions of mountain elevation, atmospheric<br>
currents, etc. We, thus, follow Lowell in ascribing the<br>
accentuation of the canals to the circulation of water in
Mars;<br>
but we assume a simple and natural mode of conveyance and do
not<br>
postulate artificial structures of all but impossible
magnitude.<br>
That vegetation may take part in the darkening of the
elevated<br>
tracts is not improbable. Indeed we would expect that in the<br>
Martian climate these tracts would be the only fertile parts
of<br>
the surface.</p>
<p>Clouds also there certainly are. More recent observations</p>
<p>197</p>
<p>appear to have set this beyond doubt. Their presence
obviously<br>
brings in other possible explanations of the coming and going
of<br>
elevated surface features.</p>
<p>Finally, we may ask what about the reliability of the maps?
About<br>
this it is to be said that the most recent map&mdash;that by
Lowell&mdash;has<br>
been confirmed by numerous drawings by different observers,
and<br>
that it is,itself the result of over 900 drawings. It has
become<br>
a standard chart of Mars, and while it would be rash to
contend<br>
for absence of errors it appears certain that the trend of
the<br>
principal canals may be relied on, as, also, the general
features<br>
of the planet's surface.</p>
<p>The question of the possibility of illusion has frequently
been<br>
raised. What I have said above to a great extent answers such<br>
objections. The close agreement between the drawings of
different<br>
observers ought really to set the matter at rest. Recently,<br>
however, photography has left no further room for scepticism.<br>
First photographed in 1905, the planet has since been<br>
photographed many thousands of times from various
observatories.<br>
A majority of the canals have been so mapped. The doubling of
the<br>
canals is stated to have been also so recorded.[1]</p>
<p>The hypothesis which I have ventured to put before you
involves<br>
no organic intervention to account for the</p>
<p>[1] E. C. Slipher's paper in _Popular Astronomy_ for March,
1914,<br>
gives a good account of the recent work.</p>
<p>198</p>
<p>details on Mars' surface. They are physical surface
features.<br>
Mars presents his history written upon his face in the scars
of<br>
former encounters&mdash;like the shield of Sir Launcelot. Some of
the<br>
most interesting inferences of mathematical and physical<br>
astronomy find a confirmation in his history. The slowing down
in<br>
the rate of axial rotation of the primary; the final
inevitable<br>
destruction of the satellite; the existence in the past of a
far<br>
larger number of asteroids than we at present are acquainted<br>
with; all these great facts are involved in the theory now<br>
advanced. If justifiably, then is Mars' face a veritable<br>
Principia.</p>
<p>To fully answer the question which heads these lectures,
we<br>
should go out into the populous solitudes (if the term be<br>
permitted) which lie beyond our system. It is well that there
is<br>
now no time left to do so; for, in fact, there we can only
dream<br>
dreams wherein the limits of the possible and the impossible<br>
become lost.</p>
<p>The marvel of the infinite number of stars is not so
marvellous<br>
as the rationality that fain would comprehend them. In
seeking<br>
other minds than ours we seek for what is almost infinitely<br>
complex and coordinated in a material universe relatively
simple<br>
and heterogeneous. In our mental attitude towards the great<br>
question, this fact must be regarded as fundamental.</p>
<p>I can only fitly close a discourse which has throughout
weighed<br>
the question of the living thought against the unthinking laws
of<br>
matter, by a paraphrase of the words</p>
<p>199</p>
<p>of a great poet when he, in higher and, perhaps, more
philosophic<br>
language, also sought to place the one in comparison with the<br>
other.[1]</p>
<p>Richter thought that he was&mdash;with his human heart<br>
unstrengthened&mdash;taken by an angel among the universe of
stars.<br>
Then, as they journeyed, our solar system was sunken like a
faint<br>
star in the abyss, and they travelled yet further, on the
wings<br>
of thought, through mightier systems: through all the
countless<br>
numbers of our galaxy. But at length these also were left
behind,<br>
and faded like a mist into the past. But this was not all.
The<br>
dawn of other galaxies appeared in the void. Stars more
countless<br>
still with insufferable light emerged. And these also were<br>
passed. And so they went through galaxies without number till
at<br>
length they stood in the great Cathedral of the Universe.
Endless<br>
were the starry aisles; endless the starry columns; infinite
the<br>
arches and the architraves of stars. And the poet saw the
mighty<br>
galaxies as steps descending to infinity, and as steps going
up<br>
to infinity.</p>
<p>Then his human heart fainted and he longed for some narrow
cell;<br>
longed to lie down in the grave that he might hide from
infinity.<br>
And he said to the angel:</p>
<p>"Angel, I can go with thee no farther. Is there, then, no end
to<br>
the universe of stars?"</p>
<p>[1] De Quincy in his _System of the Heavens_ gives a fine<br>
paraphrase of "Richter's Dream."</p>
<p>200</p>
<p>Then the angel flung up his glorious hands to the heaven
of<br>
heavens, saying "End is there none to the universe of God?
Lo!<br>
also there is no beginning."</p>
<p>201</p>
<p><u>THE LATENT IMAGE</u> [1]</p>
<p>My inclination has led me, in spite of a lively dread of<br>
incurring a charge of presumption, to address you principally
on<br>
that profound and most subtle question, the nature and mode
of<br>
formation of the photographic image. I am impelled to do so,
not<br>
only because the subject is full of fascination and
hopefulness,<br>
but because the wide topics of photographic methods or<br>
photographic applications would be quite unfittingly handled
by<br>
the president you have chosen.</p>
<p>I would first direct your attention to Sir James Dewar's<br>
remarkable result that the photographic plate retains<br>
considerable power of forming the latent image at
temperatures<br>
approaching the absolute zero&mdash;a result which, as I
submit,<br>
compels us to regard the fundamental effects progressing in
the<br>
film under the stimulus of light undulations as other than
those<br>
of a purely chemical nature. But few, if any, instances of<br>
chemical combination or decomposition are known at so low a<br>
temperature. Purely chemical actions cease, indeed, at far
higher<br>
temperatures, fluorine being among the few bodies which still<br>
show</p>
<p>[1] Presidential address to the Photographic Convention of
the<br>
United Kingdom, July, 1905. _Nature_, Vol. 72, p. 308.</p>
<p>202</p>
<p>chemical activity at the comparatively elevated temperature
of<br>
-180&deg; C. In short, this result of Sir James Dewar's suggests
that<br>
we must seek for the foundations of photographic action in
some<br>
physical or intra-atomic effect which, as in the case of<br>
radioactivity or fluorescence, is not restricted to intervals
of<br>
temperature over which active molecular vis viva prevails. It<br>
compels us to regard with doubt the role of oxidation or
other<br>
chemical action as essential, but rather points to the view
that<br>
such effects must be secondary or subsidiary. We feel, in a
word,<br>
that we must turn for guidance to some purely photo-physical<br>
effect.</p>
<p>Here, in the first place, we naturally recall the views of
Bose.<br>
This physicist would refer the formation of the image to a
strain<br>
of the bromide of silver molecule under the electric force in
the<br>
light wave, converting it into what might be regarded as an<br>
allotropic modification of the normal bromide which
subsequently<br>
responds specially to the attack of the developer. The
function<br>
of the sensitiser, according to this view, is to retard the<br>
recovery from strain. Bose obtained many suggestive parallels<br>
between the strain phenomena he was able to observe in silver
and<br>
other substances under electromagnetic radiation and the<br>
behaviour of the photographic plate when subjected to<br>
long-continued exposure to light.</p>
<p>This theory, whatever it may have to recommend it, can hardly
be<br>
regarded as offering a fundamental explanation. In the first<br>
place, we are left in the dark as to what</p>
<p>203</p>
<p>the strain may be. It may mean many and various things. We
know<br>
nothing as to the inner mechanism of its effects upon
subsequent<br>
chemical actions&mdash;or at least we cannot correlate it with
what is<br>
known of the physics of chemical activity. Finally, as will
be<br>
seen later, it is hardly adequate to account for the varying<br>
degrees of stability which may apparently characterise the
latent<br>
image. Still, there is much in Bose's work deserving of
careful<br>
consideration. He has by no means exhausted the line of<br>
investigation he has originated.</p>
<p>Another theory has doubtless been in the minds of many. I
have<br>
said we must seek guidance in some photo-physical phenomenon.<br>
There is one such which preeminently connects light and
chemical<br>
phenomena through the intermediary of the effects of the
former<br>
upon a component part of the atom. I refer to the phenomena
of<br>
photo-electricity.</p>
<p>It was ascertained by Hertz and his immediate successors
that<br>
light has a remarkable power of discharging negative<br>
electrification from the surface of bodies&mdash;especially
from<br>
certain substances. For long no explanation of the cause of
this<br>
appeared. But the electron&mdash;the ubiquitous electron&mdash;is
now known<br>
with considerable certainty to be responsible. The effect of
the<br>
electric force in the light wave is to direct or assist the<br>
electrons contained in the substance to escape from the
surface<br>
of the body. Each electron carries away a very small charge
of<br>
negative electrification. If, then, a body is</p>
<p>204</p>
<p>originally charged negatively, it will be gradually discharged
by<br>
this convective process. If it is not charged to start with,
the<br>
electrons will still be liberated at the surface of the body,
and<br>
this will acquire a positive charge. If the body is
positively<br>
charged at first, we cannot discharge it by illumination.</p>
<p>It would be superfluous for me to speak here of the nature
of<br>
electrons or of the various modes in which their presence may
be<br>
detected. Suffice it to say, in further connection with the
Hertz<br>
effect, that when projected among gaseous molecules the
electron<br>
soon attaches itself to one of these. In other words, it
ionises<br>
a molecule of the gas or confers its electric charge upon it.
The<br>
gaseous molecule may even be itself disrupted by impact of
the<br>
electron, if this is moving fast enough, and left bereft of
an<br>
electron.</p>
<p>We must note that such ionisation may be regarded as
conferring<br>
potential chemical properties upon the molecules of the gas
and<br>
upon the substance whence the electrons are derived. Similar<br>
ionisation under electric forces enters, as we now believe,
into<br>
all the chemical effects progressing in the galvanic cell,
and,<br>
indeed, generally in ionised solutes.</p>
<p>An experiment will best illustrate the principles I wish
to<br>
remind you of. A clean aluminium plate, carefully insulated by
a<br>
sulphur support, is faced by a sheet of copper-wire-gauze
placed<br>
a couple of centimetres away from it. The gauze is maintained
at<br>
a high positive</p>
<p>205</p>
<p>potential by this dry pile. A sensitive gold-leaf electroscope
is<br>
attached to the aluminium plate, and its image thrown upon
the<br>
screen. I now turn the light from this arc lamp upon the wire<br>
gauze, through which it in part passes and shines upon the<br>
aluminium plate. The electroscope at once charges up rapidly.<br>
There is a liberation of negative electrons at the surface of
the<br>
aluminium; these, under the attraction of the positive body,
are<br>
rapidly removed as ions, and the electroscope charges up<br>
positively.</p>
<p>Again, if I simply electrify negatively this aluminium plate
so<br>
that the leaves of the attached electroscope diverge widely,
and<br>
now expose it to the rays from the arc lamp, the charge, as
you<br>
see, is very rapidly dissipated. With positive electrification
of<br>
the aluminium there is no effect attendant on the
illumination.</p>
<p>Thus from the work of Hertz and his successors we know
that<br>
light, and more particularly what we call actinic light, is
an<br>
effective means of setting free electrons from certain<br>
substances. In short, our photographic agent, light, has the<br>
power of expelling from certain substances the electron which
is<br>
so potent a factor in most, if not in all, chemical effects.
I<br>
have not time here to refer to the work of Elster and Geitel<br>
whereby they have shown that this action is to be traced to
the<br>
electric force in the light wave, but must turn to the
probable<br>
bearing of this phenomenon on the familiar facts of
photography.<br>
I assume that the experiment I have shown you is the most</p>
<p>206</p>
<p>fundamental photographic experiment which it is now in our
power<br>
to make.</p>
<p>We must first ask from what substances can light liberate<br>
electrons. There are many&mdash;metals as well as non-metals
and<br>
liquids. It is a very general phenomenon and must operate
widely<br>
throughout nature. But what chiefly concerns the present<br>
consideration is the fact that the haloid salts of silver are<br>
vigorously photo-electric, and, it is suggestive, possess,<br>
according to Schmidt, an activity in the descending order<br>
bromide, chloride, iodide. This is, in other words, their
order<br>
of activity as ionisers (under the proper conditions) when<br>
exposed to ultra-violet light. Photographers will recognise
that<br>
this is also the order of their photographic sensitiveness.</p>
<p>Another class of bodies also concerns our subject: the
special<br>
sensitisers used by the photographer to modify the spectral<br>
distribution of sensibility of the haloid salts, _e.g._
eosine,<br>
fuchsine, cyanine. These again are electron-producers under
light<br>
stimulus. Now it has been shown by Stoletow, Hallwachs, and<br>
Elster and Geitel that there is an intimate connection
between<br>
photo-electric activity and the absorption of light by the<br>
substance, and, indeed, that the particular wave-lengths
absorbed<br>
by the substance are those which are effective in liberating
the<br>
electrons. Thus we have strong reason for believing that the<br>
vigorous photo-electric activity displayed by the special<br>
sensitisers must be dependent upon their colour absorption.
You<br>
will recognise that this is just</p>
<p>207</p>
<p>the connection between their photographic effects and
their<br>
behaviour towards light.</p>
<p>There is yet another suggestive parallel. I referred to
the<br>
observation of Sir James Dewar as to the continued
sensitiveness<br>
of the photographic film at the lowest attained extreme of<br>
temperature, and drew the inference that the fundamental<br>
photographic action must be of intra-atomic nature, and not<br>
dependent upon the vis viva of the molecule or atom. In then<br>
seeking the origin of photographic action in photo-electric<br>
phenomena we naturally ask, Are these latter phenomena also<br>
traceable at low temperatures? If they are, we are entitled
to<br>
look upon this fact as a qualifying characteristic or as
another<br>
link in the chain of evidence connecting photographic with<br>
photo-electric activity.</p>
<p>I have quite recently, with the aid of liquid air supplied to
me<br>
from the laboratory of the Royal Dublin Society, tested the<br>
photo-sensibility of aluminium and also of silver bromide down
to<br>
temperatures approaching that of the liquid air. The mode of<br>
observation is essentially that of Schmidt&mdash;what he terms
his<br>
static method. The substance undergoing observation is,
however,<br>
contained at the bottom of a thin copper tube, 5 cm. in
diameter,<br>
which is immersed to a depth of about 10 cm in liquid air.
The<br>
tube is closed above by a paraffin stopper which carries a
thin<br>
quartz window as well as the sulphur tubes through which the<br>
connections pass. The air within is very carefully dried by<br>
phosphorus</p>
<p>208</p>
<p>pentoxide before the experiment. The arc light is used as
source<br>
of illumination. It is found that a vigorous photo-electric<br>
effect continues in the case of the clean aluminium. In the
case<br>
of the silver bromide a distinct photo-electric effect is
still<br>
observed. I have not had leisure to make, as yet, any
trustworthy<br>
estimate of the percentage effect at this temperature in the
case<br>
of either substance. Nor have I determined the temperature<br>
accurately. The latter may be taken as roughly about -150&deg;
C,</p>
<p>Sir James Dewar's actual measilrements afforded twenty per
cent.<br>
of the normal photographic effect at -180&deg; C. and ten per
cent.<br>
at the temperature of -252.5&deg; C.</p>
<p>With this much to go upon, and the important additional fact
that<br>
the electronic discharge&mdash;as from the X-ray tube or from<br>
radium&mdash;generates the latent image, I think we are fully
entitled<br>
to suggest, as a legitimate lead to experiment, the
hypothesis<br>
that the beginnings of photographic action involve an
electronic<br>
discharge from the light-sensitive molecule; in other words
that<br>
the latent image is built up of ionised atoms or molecules
the<br>
result of the photo-electric effect on the illuminated silver<br>
haloid, and it is upon these ionised atoms that the chemical<br>
effects of the developer are subsequently directed. It may be<br>
that the liberated electrons ionise molecules not directly<br>
affected, or it may be that in their liberation they disrupt<br>
complex molecules built up in the ripening of the</p>
<p>209</p>
<p>emulsion. With the amount we have to go upon we cannot venture
to<br>
particularise. It will be said that such an action must be in<br>
part of the nature of a chemical effect. This must be
admitted,<br>
and, in so far as the rearrangement of molecular fabrics is<br>
involved, the result will doubtless be controlled by
temperature<br>
conditions. The facts observed by Sir James Dewar support
this.<br>
But there is involved a fundamental process&mdash;the liberation
of the<br>
electron by the electric force in the light wave, which is a<br>
physical effect, and which, upon the hypothesis of its reality
as<br>
a factor in forming the latent image, appears to explain<br>
completely the outstanding photographic sensitiveness of the
film<br>
at temperatures far below those at which chemical actions in<br>
general cease.</p>
<p>Again, we may assume that the electron&mdash;producing power
of the<br>
special sensitiser or dye for the particular ray it absorbs
is<br>
responsible, or responsible in part, for the special<br>
sensitiveness it confers upon the film. Sir Wm. Abney has
shown<br>
that these sensitisers are active even if laid on as a varnish
on<br>
the sensitive surface and removed before development. It must
be<br>
remembered, however, that at temperatures of about -50&deg;
these<br>
sensitisers lose much of their influence on the film; as I
have<br>
pointed out in a paper read before the Photographic Convention
of<br>
1894.</p>
<p>It. appears to me that on these views the curious phenomenon
of<br>
recurrent reversals does not present a problem hopeless of<br>
explanation. The process of photo-</p>
<p>210</p>
<p>ionisation constituting the latent image, where the ion is<br>
probably not immediately neutralised by chemical combination,<br>
presents features akin to the charging of a capacity&mdash;say a
Leyden<br>
jar. There may be a rising potential between the groups of
ions<br>
until ultimately a point is attained when there is a
spontaneous<br>
neutralisation. I may observe that the phenomena of reversal<br>
appear to indicate that the change in the silver bromide<br>
molecule, whatever be its nature, is one of gradually
increasing<br>
intensity, and finally attains a maximum when a return to the<br>
original condition occurs. The maximum is the point of most<br>
intense developable image. It is probable that the
sensitiser&mdash;in<br>
this case the gelatin in which the bromide of silver is<br>
immersed&mdash;plays a part in the conditions of stability which
are<br>
involved.</p>
<p>Of great interest in all our considerations and theories is
the<br>
recent work of Wood on photographic reversal. The result of
this<br>
work is&mdash;as I take it&mdash;to show that the stability of
the latent<br>
image may be very various according to the mode of its
formation.<br>
Thus it appears that the sort of latent effect which is
produced<br>
by pressure or friction is the least stable of any. This may
be<br>
reversed or wiped out by the application of any other known
form<br>
of photographic stimulus. Thus an exposure to X-rays will<br>
obliterate it, or a very brief exposure to light. The latent<br>
image arising from X-rays is next in order of increasing<br>
stability. Light action will remove this. Third in order is a<br>
very brief light-shock or sudden flash. This</p>
<p>211</p>
<p>cannot be reversed by any of the foregoing modes of
stimulation,<br>
but a long-continued undulatory stimulus, as from lamp-light,<br>
will reverse it. Last and most stable of all is the gradually<br>
built-up configuration due to long-continued light exposure.
This<br>
can only be reversed by overdoing it according to the known
facts<br>
of recurrent reversal. Wood takes occasion to remark that
these<br>
phenomena are in bad agreement with the strain theory of Bose.
We<br>
have, in fact, but the one resource&mdash;the allotropic
modification<br>
of the haloid&mdash;whereby to explain all these orders of
stability.<br>
It appears to me that the elasticity of the electronic theory
is<br>
greater. The state of the ionised system may be very various<br>
according as it arises from continued rhythmic effects or
from<br>
unorganised shocks. The ionisation due to X-rays or to
friction<br>
will probably be quite unorganised, that due to light more or<br>
less stable according to the gradual and gentle nature of the<br>
forces at work. I think we are entitled to conclude that on
the<br>
whole there is nothing in Wood's beautiful experiments opposed
to<br>
the photo-electric origin of photographic effects, but that
they<br>
rather fall in with what might be anticipated according to
that<br>
theory.</p>
<p>When we look for further support to the views I have laid
before<br>
you we are confronted with many difficulties. I have not as
yet<br>
detected any electronic discharge from the film under light<br>
stimulus. This may be due to my defective experiments, or to
a<br>
fact noted by Elster and Geitel concerning the photo-electric<br>
properties of gelatin.</p>
<p>212</p>
<p>They obtained a vigorous effect from Balmain's luminous
paint,<br>
but when this was mixed in gelatin there was no external
effect.<br>
Schmidt's results as to the continuance of photo-electric<br>
activity when bodies in general are dissolved in each other
lead<br>
us to believe that an actual conservative property of the
medium<br>
and not an effect of this on the luminous paint is here
involved.<br>
This conservative effect of the gelatin may be concerned with
its<br>
efficacy as a sensitiser.</p>
<p>In the views I have laid before you I have endeavoured to
show<br>
that the recent addition to our knowledge of the electron as
an<br>
entity taking part in many physical and chemical effects
should<br>
be kept in sight in seeking an explanation of the mode of
origin<br>
of the latent image.[1]</p>

ingenious extensions of the views expressed above, see<br>

<p><u>PLEOCHROIC HALOES</u> [1]</p>
<p>IT is now well established that a helium atom is expelled
from<br>
certain of the radioactive elements at the moment of<br>
transformation. The helium atom or alpha ray leaves the<br>
transforming atom with a velocity which varies in the
different<br>
radioactive elements, but which is always very great,
attaining<br>
as much as 2 x 109 cms. per second; a velocity which, if<br>
unchecked, would carry the atom round the earth in less than
two<br>
seconds. The alpha ray carries a positive charge of double
the<br>
ionic amount.</p>
<p>When an alpha ray is discharged from the transforming
element<br>
into a gaseous medium its velocity is rapidly checked and its<br>
energy absorbed. A certain amount of energy is thus
transferred<br>
from the transforming atom to the gas. We recognise this
energy<br>
in the gas by the altered properties of the latter; chiefly
by<br>
the fact that it becomes a conductor of electricity. The<br>
mechanism by which this change is effected is in part known.
The<br>
atoms of the gas, which appear to be freely penetrated by the<br>
alpha ray, are so far dismembered as to yield charged
electrons<br>
or ions; the atoms remaining charged with an equal and
opposite<br>
charge. Such a medium of</p>

of<br>
Birmingham on October 30th, 1912. Bedrock, Jan., 1913.</p>
<p>214</p>
<p>free electric charges becomes a conductor of electricity
by<br>
convection when an electromotive force is applied. The gas
also<br>
acquires other properties in virtue of its ionisation. Under<br>
certain conditions it may acquire chemical activity and new<br>
combinations may be formed or existing ones broken up. When
its<br>
initial velocity is expended the helium atom gives up its<br>
properties as an alpha ray and thenceforth remains possessed
of<br>
the ordinary varying velocity of thermal agitation. Bragg and<br>
Kleeman and others have investigated the career of the alpha
ray<br>
when its path or range lies in a gas at ordinary or
obtainable<br>
conditions of pressure and temperature. We will review some

the facts ascertained.</p>

<p>It will be seen that the ray of greatest range is that
proceeding<br>
from thorium C2, which reaches a distance of 8.6 cms. In the<br>
uranium family the fastest ray is</p>
<p>215</p>
<p>that of radium C. It attains 6.94 cms. There is thus an<br>
appreciable difference between the ultimate distances
traversed<br>
by the most energetic rays of the two families. The shortest<br>
ranges are those of uranium 1 and 2.</p>
<p>The ionisation effected by these rays is by no means
uniform<br>
along the path of the ray. By examining the conductivity of
the<br>
gas at different points along the path of the ray, the
ionisation<br>
at these points may be determined. At the limits of the range
the<br>
ionisation</p>
<p>{Fig. 13}</p>
<p>ceases. In this manner the range is, in fact, determined.
The<br>
dotted curve (Fig. 13) depicts the recent investigation of
the<br>
ionisation effected by a sheaf of parallel rays of radium C
in<br>
air, as determined by Geiger. The range is laid out
horizontally<br>
in centimetres. The numbers of ions are laid out vertically.
The<br>
remarkable nature of the results will be at once apparent. We<br>
should have expected that the ray at the beginning of its
path,<br>
when its velocity and kinetic energy were greatest, would
have<br>
been more effective than towards the end of its range</p>
<p>216</p>
<p>when its energy had almost run out. But the curve shows that
it<br>
is just the other way. The lagging ray, about to resign its<br>
ionising properties, becomes a much more efficient ioniser
than<br>
it was at first. The maximum efficiency is, however, in the
case<br>
of a bundle of parallel rays, not quite at the end of the
range,<br>
but about half a centimetre from it. The increase to the
maximum<br>
is rapid, the fall from the maximum to nothing is much more<br>
rapid.</p>
<p>It can be shown that the ionisation effected anywhere along
the<br>
path of the ray is inversely proportional to the velocity of
the<br>
ray at that point. But this evidently does not apply to the
last<br>
5 or 10 mms. of the range where the rate of ionisation and of
the<br>
speed of the ray change most rapidly. To what are the
changing<br>
properties of the rays near the end of their path to be
ascribed?<br>
It is only recently that this matter has been elucidated.</p>
<p>When the alpha ray has sufficiently slowed down, its power
of<br>
passing right through atoms, without appreciably experiencing
any<br>
effects from them, diminishes. The opposing atoms begin to
exert<br>
an influence on the path of the ray, deflecting it a little.
The<br>
heavier atoms will deflect it most. This effect has been very<br>
successfully investigated by Geiger. It is known as
"scattering."<br>
The angle of scattering increases rapidly with the decrease
of<br>
velocity. Now the effect of the scattering will be to cause
some<br>
of the rays to complete their ranges</p>
<p>217</p>
<p>or, more accurately, to leave their direct line of advance
a<br>
little sooner than others. In the beautiful experiments of C.
T.<br>
R. Wilson we are enabled to obtain ocular demonstration of
the<br>
scattering. The photograph (Fig. 14.), which I owe to the<br>
kindness of Mr. Wilson, shows the deflection of the ray
towards<br>
the end of its path. In</p>
<p>{Fig. 14}</p>
<p>this case the path of the ray has been rendered visible by
the<br>
condensation of water particles under the influence of the<br>
ionisation; the atmosphere in which the ray travels being in
a<br>
state of supersaturation with water vapour at the instant of
the<br>
passage of the ray. It is evident that if we were observing
the<br>
ionisation along a sheaf of parallel rays, all starting with<br>
equal velocity,</p>
<p>218</p>
<p>the effect of the bending of some of the rays near the end
of<br>
their range must be to cause a decrease in the aggregate<br>
ionisation near the very end of the ultimate range. For, in
fact,<br>
some of the rays complete their work of ionising at points in
the<br>
gas before the end is reached. This is the cause, or at least
an<br>
important contributory cause, of the decline in the
ionisation<br>
near the end of the range, when the effects of a bundle of
rays<br>
are being observed. The explanation does not suggest that the<br>
ionising power of any one ray is actually diminished before
it<br>
finally ceases to be an alpha ray.</p>
<p>The full line in Fig. 13 gives the ionisation curve which it
may<br>
be expected would be struck out by a single alpha ray. In it
the<br>
ionisation goes on increasing till it abruptly ceases
altogether,<br>
with the entire loss of the initial kinetic energy of the<br>
particle.</p>
<p>A highly remarkable fact was found out by Bragg. The effect
of<br>
the atom traversed by the ray in checking the velocity of the
ray<br>
is independent of the physical and chemical condition of the<br>
atom. He measured the "stopping power" of a medium by the<br>
distance the ray can penetrate into it compared with the
distance<br>
to which it can penetrate in air. The less the ratio the
greater<br>
is the stopping power. The stopping power of a substance is<br>
proportional to the square root of its atomic weight. The<br>
stopping power of an atom is not altered if it is in chemical<br>
union with another atom. The atomic weight is the one quality
of<br>
importance. The physical</p>
<p>219</p>
<p>state, whether the element is in the solid, liquid or
gaseous<br>
state, is unimportant. And when we deal with molecules the<br>
stopping power is simply proportional to the sum of the
square<br>
roots of the atomic weights of the atoms entering into the<br>
molecule. This is the "additive law," and it obviously enables
us<br>
to calculate what the range in any substance of known
chemical<br>
composition and density will be, compared with the range in
air.</p>
<p>This is of special importance in connection with phenomena
we<br>
have presently to consider. It means that, knowing the
chemical<br>
composition and density of any medium whatsoever, solid,
liquid<br>
or gaseous, we can calculate accurately the distance to which
any<br>
particular alpha ray will penetrate. Nor have the temperature
and<br>
pressure to which the medium is subjected any influence save
in<br>
so far as they may affect the proximity of one atom to
another.<br>
The retardation of the alpha ray in the atom is not affected.</p>
<p>This valuable additive law, however, cannot be applied in<br>
strictness to the amount of ionisation attending the ray. The<br>
form of the molecule, or more generally its volume, may have
an<br>
influence upon this. Bragg draws the conclusion, from this
fact<br>
as well as from the notable increase of ionisation with loss
of<br>
speed, that the ionisation is dependent upon the time the ray<br>
spends in the molecule. The energy of the ray is, indeed,
found<br>
to be less efficient in producing ionisation in the smaller<br>
atomm.</p>
<p>220</p>
<p>Before leaving our review of the general laws governing
the<br>
passage of alpha rays through matter, another point of
interest<br>
must be referred to. We have hitherto spoken in general terms
of<br>
the fact that ionisation attends the passage of the ray. We
have<br>
said nothing as to the nature of the ionisation so produced.
But<br>
in point of fact the ionisation due to an alpha ray is sui<br>
generis. A glance at one of Wilson's photographs (Fig. 14.)<br>
illustrates this. The white streak of water particles marks
the<br>
path of the ray. The ions produced are evidently closely
crowded<br>
along the track of the ray. They have been called into
existence<br>
in a very minute instant of time. Now we know that ions of<br>
opposite sign if left to themselves recombine. The rate of<br>
recombination depends upon the product of the number of each
sign<br>
present in unit volume. Here the numbers are very great and
the<br>
volume very small. The ionic density is therefore high, and<br>
recombination very rapidly removes the ions after they are<br>
formed. We see here a peculiarity of the ionisation effected
by<br>
alpha rays. It is linear in distribution and very local. Much
of<br>
the ionisation in gases is again undone by recombination
before<br>
diffusion leads to the separation of the ions. This "initial<br>
recombination" is greatest towards the end of the path of the
ray<br>
where the ionisation is a maximum. Here it may be so
effective<br>
that the form of the curve is completely lost unless a very
large<br>
electromotive force is used to separate the ions when the<br>
ionisation is being investigated.</p>
<p>221</p>
<p>We have now reviewed recent work at sufficient length to<br>
understand something of the nature of the most important
advance<br>
ever made in our knowledge of the atom. Let us glance briefly
at<br>
what we have learned. The radioactive atom in sinking to a
lower<br>
atomic weight casts out with enormous velocity an atom of
helium.<br>
It thus loses a definite portion of its mass and of its
energy.<br>
Helium which is chemically one of the most inert of the
elements,<br>
is, when possessed of such great kinetic energy, able to<br>
penetrate and ionise the atoms which it meets in its path. It<br>
spends its energy in the act of ionising them, coming to
rest,<br>
when it moves in air, in a few centimetres. Its initial
velocity<br>
depends upon the particular radioactive element which has
given<br>
rise to it. The length of its path is therefore different<br>
according to the radioactive element from which it proceeds.
The<br>
retardation which it experiences in its path depends entirely<br>
upon the atomic weight of the atoms which it traverses. As it<br>
advances in its path its effectiveness in ionising the atom<br>
rapidly increases and attains a very marked maximum. In a gas
the<br>
ions produced being much crowded together recombine rapidly;
so<br>
rapidly that the actual ionisation may be quite concealed
unless<br>
a sufficiently strong electric force is applied to separate
them.<br>
Such is a brief summary of the climax of radioactive<br>
discovery:&mdash;the birth, life and death of the alpha ray. Its
advent<br>
into Science has altered fundamentally our conception of</p>
<p>222</p>
<p>matter. It is fraught with momentous bearings upon
Geological<br>
Science. How the work of the alpha ray is sometimes recorded<br>
visibly in the rocks and what we may learn from that record,
I<br>
propose now to bring before you.</p>
<p>In certain minerals, notably the brown variety of mica known
as<br>
biotite, the microscope reveals minute circular marks
occurring<br>
here and there, quite irregularly. The most usual appearance
is<br>
that of a circular area darker in colour than the surrounding<br>
mineral. The radii of these little disc-shaped marks when
well<br>
defined are found to be remarkably uniform, in some cases
four<br>
hundredths of a millimetre and in others three hundredths,
about.<br>
These are the measurements in biotite. In other minerals the<br>
measurements are not quite the same as in biotite. Such
minute<br>
objects are quite invisible to the naked eye. In some rocks
they<br>
are very abundant, indeed they may be crowded together in
such<br>
numbers as to darken the colour of the mineral containing
them.<br>
They have long been a mystery to petrologists.</p>
<p>Close examination shows that there is always a small speck of
a<br>
foreign body at the centre of the circle, and it is often<br>
possible to identify the nature of this central substance,
small<br>
though it be. Most generally it is found to be the mineral<br>
zircon. Now this mineral was shown by Strutt to contain radium
in<br>
quantities much exceeding those found in ordinary rock<br>
substances.</p>
<p>223</p>
<p>Some other mineral may occasionally form the nucleus, but
we<br>
never find any which is not known to be specially likely to<br>
contain a radioactive substance. Another circumstance we
notice.<br>
The smaller this central nucleus the more perfect in form is
the<br>
darkened circular area surrounding it. When the circle is
very<br>
perfect and the central mineral clearly defined at its centre
we<br>
find by measurement that the radius of the darkened area is<br>
generally 0.033 mm. It may sometimes be 0.040 mm. These are<br>
always the measurements in biotite. In other minerals the
radii<br>
are a little different.</p>
<p>We see in the photograph (Pl. XXIII, lower figure), much<br>
magnified, a halo contained in biotite. We are looking at a<br>
region in a rock-section, the rock being ground down to such
a<br>
thickness that light freely passes through it. The biotite is
in<br>
the centre of the field. Quartz and felspar surround it. The
rock<br>
is a granite. The biotite is not all one crystal. Two
crystals,<br>
mutually inclined, are cut across. The halo extends across
both<br>
crystals, but owing to the fact that polarised light is used
in<br>
taking the photograph it appears darker in one crystal than
in<br>
the other. We see the zircon which composes the nucleus. The
fine<br>
striated appearance of the biotite is due to the cleavage of
that<br>
mineral, which is cut across in the section.</p>
<p>The question arises whether the darkened area surrounding
the<br>
zircon may not be due to the influence of the radioactive<br>
substances contained in the zircon. The</p>
<p>224</p>
<p>extraordinary uniformity of the radial measurements of
perfectly<br>
formed haloes (to use the name by which they have long been<br>
known) suggests that they may be the result of alpha
radiation.<br>
For in that case, as we have seen, we can at once account for
the<br>
definite radius as simply representing the range of the ray
in<br>
biotite. The furthest-reaching ray will define the radius of
the<br>
halo. In the case of the uranium family this will be radium
C,<br>
and in the case of thorium it will be thorium C. Now here we<br>
possess a means of at once confirming or rejecting the view
that<br>
the halo is a radioactive phenomenon and occasioned by alpha<br>
radiation; for we can calculate what the range of these rays
will<br>
be in biotite, availing ourselves of Bragg's additive law,<br>
already referred to. When we make this calculation we find
that<br>
radium C just penetrates 0.033 mm. and thorium C 0.040 mm.
The<br>
proof is complete that we are dealing with the effects of
alpha<br>
rays. Observe now that not only is the coincidence of
measurement<br>
and calculation a proof of the view that alpha radiation has<br>
occasioned the halo, but it is a very complete verification
of<br>
the important fact stated by Bragg, that the stopping power<br>
depends solely on the atomic weight of the atoms traversed by
the<br>
ray.</p>
<p>We have seen that our examination of the rocks reveals only
the<br>
two sorts of halo: the radium halo and the thorium halo. This
is<br>
not without teaching. For why not find an actinium halo? Now<br>
Rutherford long ago suggested that this element and its<br>
derivatives were</p>
<p>225</p>
<p>probably an offspring of the uranium family; a side branch, as
it<br>
were, in the formation of which relatively few transforming
atoms<br>
took part. On Rutherford's theory then, actinium should
always<br>
accompany uranium and radium, but in very subordinate amount.
The<br>
absence of actinium haloes clearly supports this view. For if<br>
actinium was an independent element we would be sure to find<br>
actinium haloes. The difference in radius should be
noticeable.<br>
If, on the other hand, actinium</p>
<p>was always associated with uranium and radium, then its
effects<br>
would be submerged in those of the much more potent effects
of<br>
the uranium series of elements.</p>
<p>It will have occurred to you already that if the
radioactive<br>
origin of the halo is assured the shape of a halo is not
really<br>
circular, but spherical. This is so. There is no such thing as
a<br>
disc-shaped halo. The halo is a spherical volume containing
the<br>
radioactive nucleus at its centre. The true radius of the
halo<br>
may, therefore, only be measured on sections passing through
the<br>
nucleus.</p>
<p>226</p>
<p>In order to understand the mode of formation of a halo we
may<br>
profitably study on a diagram the events which go on within
the<br>
halo-sphere. Such a diagram is seen in Fig. 15. It shows to<br>
relatively correct scale the limiting range of all the
alpha-ray<br>
producing members of the uranium and thorium families. We
know<br>
that each member of a family will exist in equilibrium amount<br>
within the nucleus possessing the parent element. Each alpha
ray<br>
leaving the nucleus will just attain its range and then cease
to<br>
affect the mica. Within the halosphere, there must be,
therefore,<br>
the accumulated effects of the influences of all the rays.
Each<br>
has its own sphere of influence, and the spheres are all<br>
concentric.</p>
<p>The radii in biotite of the several spheres are given in
the<br>
following table</p>

<p>In the photograph (Pl. XXIV, lower figure), we see a uranium
and<br>
a thorium halo in the same crystal of mica. The mica is
contained<br>
in a rock-section and is cut across the cleavage. The effects
of<br>
thorium Ca are clearly shown</p>
<p>227</p>
<p>as a lighter border surrounding the accumulated inner
darkening<br>
due to the other thorium rays. The uranium halo (to the
right)<br>
similarly shows the effects of radium C, but less distinctly.</p>
<p>Haloes which are uniformly dark all over as described above
are,<br>
in point of fact, "over-exposed"; to borrow a familiar<br>
photographic term. Haloes are found which show much beautiful<br>
internal detail. Too vigorous action obscures this detail just
as<br>
detail is lost in an over-exposed photograph. We may again
have<br>
"under-exposed" haloes in which the action of the several rays
is<br>
incomplete or in which the action of certain of the rays has
left<br>
little if any trace. Beginning at the most under-exposed
haloes<br>
we find circular dark marks having the radius 0.012 or 0.013
mm.<br>
These haloes are due to uranium, although their inner
darkening<br>
is doubtless aided by the passage of rays which were too few
to<br>
extend the darkening beyond the vigorous effects of the two<br>
uranium rays. Then we find haloes carried out to the radii
0.016,<br>
0.018 and 0.019 mm. The last sometimes show very beautiful
outer<br>
rings having radial dimensions such as would be produced by<br>
radium A and radium C. Finally we may have haloes in which<br>
interior detail is lost so far out as the radius due to
emanation<br>
or radium A, while outside this floats the ring due to radium
C.<br>
Certain variations of these effects may occur, marking,<br>
apparently, different stages of exposure. Plates XXIII and
XXIV<br>
(upper figure) illustrate some of these stages;</p>
<p>228</p>
<p>the latter photograph being greatly enlarged to show clearly
the<br>
halo-sphere of radium A.</p>
<p>In most of the cases mentioned above the structure
evidently<br>
shows the existence of concentric spherical shells of
darkened<br>
biotite. This is a very interesting fact. For it proves that
in<br>
the mineral the alpha ray gives rise to the same increased<br>
ionisation towards the end of its range, as Bragg determined
in<br>
the case of gases. And we must conclude that the halo in
every<br>
case grows in this manner. A spherical shell of darkened
biotite<br>
is first produced and the inner colouration is only effected
as<br>
the more feeble ionisation along the track of the ray in
course<br>
of ages gives rise to sufficient alteration of the mineral.
This<br>
more feeble ionisation is, near the nucleus, enhanced in its<br>
effects by the fact that there all the rays combine to
increase<br>
the ionisation and, moreover, the several tracks are there<br>
crowded by the convergency to the centre. Hence the most<br>
elementary haloes seldom show definite rings due to uranium,<br>
etc., but appear as embryonic disc-like markings. The
photographs<br>
illustrate many of the phases of halo development.</p>
<p>Rutherford succeeded in making a halo artificially by
compressing<br>
into a capillary glass tube a quantity of the emanation of<br>
radium. As the emanation decayed the various derived products<br>
came into existence and all the several alpha rays penetrated
the<br>
glass, darkening the walls of the capillary out to the limit
of<br>
the range of radium C in glass. Plate XXV shows a magnified<br>
section of the</p>
<p>229</p>
<p>tube. The dark central part is the capillary. The tubular
halo<br>
surrounds it. This experiment has, however, been anticipated
by<br>
some scores of millions of years, for here is the same effect
in<br>
a biotite crystal (Pl. XXV). Along what are apparently
tubular<br>
passages or cracks in the mica, a solution, rich in
radioactive<br>
substances, has moved; probably during the final consolidation
of<br>
the granite in which the mica occurs. A continuous and very<br>
regular halo has developed along these conduits. A string of<br>
halo-spheres may lie along such passages. We must infer that<br>
solutions or gases able to establish the radioactive nuclei
moved<br>
along these conduits, and we are entitled to ask if all the<br>
haloes in this biotite are not, in this sense, of secondary<br>
origin. There is, I may add, much to support such a
conclusion.</p>
<p>The widespread distribution of radioactive substances is
most<br>
readily appreciated by examination of sections of rocks cut
thin<br>
enough for microscopic investigation. It is, indeed, difficult
to<br>
find, in the older rocks of granitic type, mica which does
not<br>
show haloes, or traces of haloes. Often we find that every one
of<br>
the inclusions in the mica&mdash;that is, every one of the
earlier<br>
formed substances&mdash;contain radioactive elements, as
indicated by<br>
the presence of darkened borders. As will be seen presently
the<br>
quantities involved are generally vanishingly small. For
example<br>
it was found by direct determination that in one gram of the<br>
halo-rich mica of Co. Carlow there was rather less than
twelve<br>
billionths of a gram of radium, We are</p>
<p>230</p>
<p>entitled to infer that other rare elements are similarly
widely<br>
distributed but remain undetectable because of their more
stable<br>
properties.</p>
<p>It must not be thought that the under-exposed halo is a
recent<br>
creation. By no means. All are old, appallingly old; and in
the<br>
same rock all are, probably, of the same, or neatly the same,<br>
age. The under-exposure is simply due to a lesser quantity of
the<br>
radioactive elements in the nucleus. They are under-exposed,
in<br>
short, not because of lesser duration of exposure, but because
of<br>
insufficient action; as when in taking a photograph the stop
is<br>
not open enough for the time of the exposure.</p>
<p>The halo has, so far, told us that the additive law is obeyed
in<br>
solid media, and that the increased ionisation attending the<br>
slowing down of the ray obtaining in gases, also obtains in<br>
solids; for, otherwise, the halo would not commence its<br>
development as a spherical shell or envelope. But here we
learn<br>
that there is probably a certain difference in the course of<br>
events attending the immediate passage of the ray in the gas
and<br>
in the solid. In the former, initial recombination may
obscure<br>
the intense ionisation near the end of the range. We can only<br>
detect the true end-effects by artificially separating the
ions<br>
by a strong electric force. If this recombination happened in
the<br>
mineral we should not have the concentric spheres so well
defined<br>
as we see them to be. What, then, hinders the initial<br>
recombination in the solid? The answer probably is that the
newly<br>
formed</p>
<p>231</p>
<p>ion is instantly used up in a fresh chemical combination. Nor
is<br>
it free to change its place as in the gas. There is simply a
new<br>
equilibrium brought about by its sudden production. In this<br>
manner the conditions in the complex molecule of biotite,<br>
tourmaline, etc., may be quite as effective in preventing
initial<br>
recombination as the most effective electric force we could<br>
apply. The final result is that we find the Bragg curve<br>
reproduced most accurately in the delicate shading of the
rings<br>
making up the perfectly exposed halo.</p>
<p>That the shading of the rings reproduces the form of the
Bragg<br>
curve, projected, as it were, upon the line of advance of the
ray<br>
and reproduced in depth of shading, shows that in yet another<br>
particular the alpha ray behaves much the same in the solid as
in<br>
the gas. A careful examination of the outer edge of the
circles<br>
always reveals a steep but not abrupt cessation of the action
of<br>
the ray. Now Geiger has investigated and proved the existence
of<br>
scattering of the alpha ray by solids. We may, therefore,
suppose<br>
with much probability that there is the same scattering
within<br>
the mineral near the end of the range. The heavy iron atom of
the<br>
biotite is, doubtless, chiefly responsible for this in
biotite<br>
haloes. I may observe that this shading of the outer bounding<br>
surface of the sphere of action is found however minute the<br>
central nucleus. In the case of a nucleus of considerable
size<br>
another effect comes in which tends to produce an enhanced<br>
shading. This will</p>
<p>232</p>
<p>result if rays proceed from different depths in the nucleus.
If<br>
the nucleus were of the same density and atomic weight as the<br>
surrounding mica, there would be little effect. But its
density<br>
and molecular weight are generally greater, hence the
retardation<br>
is greater, and rays proceeding from deep in the nucleus<br>
experience more retardation than those which proceed from
points<br>
near to the surface. The distances reached by the rays in the<br>
mica will vary accordingly, and so there will be a gradual<br>
cessation of the effects of the rays.</p>
<p>The result of our study of the halo may be summed up in
the<br>
statement that in nearly every particular we have the
phenomena,<br>
which have been measured and observed in the gas, reproduced on
a<br>
minute scale in the halo. Initial recombination seems,
however,<br>
to be absent or diminished in effectiveness; probably because
of<br>
the new stability instantly assumed by the ionised atoms.</p>
<p>One of the most interesting points about the halo remains to
be<br>
referred to. The halo is always uniformly darkened all round
its<br>
circumference and is perfectly spherical. Sections, whether
taken<br>
in the plane of cleavage of the mica or across it, show the
same<br>
exactly circular form, and the same radius. Of course, if
there<br>
was any appreciable increase of range along or across the<br>
cleavage the form of the halo on the section across the
cleavage<br>
should be elliptical. The fact that there is no measurable<br>
ellipticity is, I think, one which on first consideration
would<br>
not be expected.</p>
<p>233</p>
<p>For what are the conditions attending the passage of the ray
in a<br>
medium such as mica? According to crystallographic conceptions
we<br>
have here an orderly arrangement of molecules, the units<br>
composing the crystal being alike in mass, geometrically
spaced,<br>
and polarised as regards the attractions they exert one upon<br>
another. Mica, more especially, has the cleavage phenomenon<br>
developed to a degree which transcends its development in any<br>
other known substance. We can cleave it and again cleave it
till<br>
its flakes float in the air, and we may yet go on cleaving it
by<br>
special means till the flakes no longer reflect visible
light.<br>
And not less remarkable is the uniplanar nature of its
cleavage.<br>
There is little cleavage in any plane but the one, although it
is<br>
easy to show that the molecules in the plane of the flake are
in<br>
orderly arrangement and are more easily parted in some
directions<br>
than in others. In such a medium beyond all others we must
look<br>
with surprise upon the perfect sphere struck out by the alpha<br>
rays, because it seems certain that the cleavage is due to
lesser<br>
attraction, and, probably, further spacing of the molecules, in
a<br>
direction perpendicular to the cleavage.</p>
<p>It may turn out that the spacing of the molecules will
influence<br>
but little the average number per unit distance encountered
by<br>
rays moving in divergent paths. If this is so, we seem left
to<br>
conclude that, in spite of its unequal and polarised
attractions,<br>
there is equal retardation and equal ionisation in the
molecule<br>
in whatever</p>
<p>234</p>
<p>direction it is approached. Or, again, if the encounters
indeed<br>
differ in number, then some compensating effect must exist<br>
whereby a direction of lesser linear density involves greater<br>
stopping power in the molecule encountered, and vice versa.</p>
<p>The nature of the change produced by the alpha rays is
unknown.<br>
But the formation of the halo is not, at least in its earlier<br>
stages, attended by destruction of the crystallographic and<br>
optical properties of the medium. The optical properties are<br>
unaltered in nature but are increased in intensity. This
applies<br>
till the halo has become so darkened that light is no longer<br>
transmitted under the conditions of thickness obtaining in
rock<br>
sections. It is well known that there is in biotite a maximum<br>
absorption of a plane-polarised light ray, when the plane of<br>
vibration coincides with the plane of cleavage. A section
across<br>
the cleavage then shows a maximum amount of absorption. A
halo<br>
seen on this section simply produces this effect in a more<br>
intense degree. This is well shown in Plate XXIII (lower
figure),<br>
on a portion of the halo-sphere. The descriptive name
"Pleochroic<br>
Halo" has originated from this fact. We must conclude that
the<br>
effect of the ionisation due to the alpha ray has not been to<br>
alter fundamentally the conditions which give rise to the
optical<br>
properties of the medium. The increased absorption is
probably<br>
associated with some change in the chemical state of the iron<br>
present. Haloes are, I believe, not found in minerals from
which<br>
this</p>
<p>235</p>
<p>element is absent. One thing is quite certain. The colouration
is<br>
not due to an accumulation of helium atoms, _i.e._ of spent
alpha<br>
rays. The evidence for this is conclusive. If helium was<br>
responsible we should have haloes produced in all sorts of<br>
colourless minerals. Now we sometimes see zircons in felspars
and<br>
in quartz, etc., but in no such case is a halo produced. And<br>
halo-spheres formed within and sufficiently close to the edge
of<br>
a crystal of mica are abruptly truncated by neighbouring areas
of<br>
fclspar or quartz, although we know that the rays must pass<br>
freely across the boundary. Again it is easy to show that even
in<br>
the oldest haloes the quantity of helium involved is so small<br>
that one might say the halo-sphere was a tolerably good vacuum
as<br>
regards helium. There is, finally, no reason to suppose that
the<br>
imprisoned helium would exhibit such a colouration, or,
indeed,<br>
any at all.</p>
<p>I have already referred to the great age of the halo. Haloes
are<br>
not found in the younger igneous rocks. It is probable that a<br>
halo less than a million years old has never been seen. This,<br>
prim&acirc; facie, indicates an extremely slow rate of formation.
And<br>
our calculations quite support the conclusions that the growth
of<br>
a halo, if this has been uniform, proceeds at a rate of
almost<br>
unimaginable slowness.</p>
<p>Let us calculate the number of alpha rays which may have gone
to<br>
form a halo in the Devonian granite of Leinster.</p>
<p>236</p>
<p>It is common to find haloes developed perfectly in this
granite,<br>
and having a nucleus of zircon less than 5 x 10<sup>-4</sup> cms.
in<br>
diameter. The volume of zircon is 65 x 10<sup>-12</sup> c.cs. and
the mass<br>
3 x 10<sup>-10</sup> grm.; and if there was in this zircon
10<sup>-8</sup> grm. radium<br>
per gram (a quantity about five times the greatest amount<br>
measured by Strutt), the mass of radium involved is 3 x
10<sup>-18</sup><br>
grm. From this and from the fact ascertained by Rutherford
that<br>
the number of alpha rays expelled by a gram of radium in one<br>
second is 3.4 x 10<sup>10</sup>, we find that three rays are shot
from the<br>
nucleus in a year. If, now, geological time since the Devonian
is<br>
50 millions of years, then 150 millions of rays built up the<br>
halo. If geological time since the Devonian is 400 millions
of<br>
years, then 1,200 millions of alpha rays are concerned in its<br>
genesis. The number of ions involved, of course, greatly
exceeds<br>
these numbers. A single alpha ray fired from radium C will<br>
produce 2.37 x 10<sup>5</sup> ions in air.</p>
<p>But haloes may be found quite clearly defined and fairly dark
out<br>
to the range of the emanation ray and derived from much less<br>
quantities of radioactive materials. Thus a zircon nucleus with
a<br>
diameter of but 3.4 x 10<sup>-4</sup> cms. formed a halo strongly
darkened<br>
within, and showing radium A and radium C as clear smoky
rings.<br>
Such a nucleus, on the assumption made above as to its radium<br>
content, expels one ray in a year. But, again, haloes are<br>
observed with less blackened pupils and with faint ring due
to<br>
radium C, formed round nuclei</p>
<p>237</p>
<p>of rather less than 2 x 10<sup>-4</sup> cms. diameter. Such
nuclei would<br>
expel one ray in five years. And even lesser nuclei will
generate<br>
in these old rocks haloes with their earlier characteristic<br>
features clearly developed. In the case of the most minute<br>
nuclei, if my assumption as to the uranium content is correct,
an<br>
alpha ray is expelled, probably, no oftener than once in a<br>
century; and possibly at still longer intervals.</p>
<p>The equilibrium amount of radium contained in some nuclei
may<br>
amount to only a few atoms. Even in the case of the larger
nuclei<br>
and more perfectly developed haloes the quantity of radium<br>
involved is many millions of times less than the least amount
we<br>
can recognise by any other means. But the delicacy of the<br>
observation is not adequately set forth in this statement. We
can<br>
not only tell the nature of the radioactive family with which
we<br>
are dealing; but we can recognise the presence of some of its<br>
constituent members. I may say that it is not probable the<br>
zircons are richer in radium than I have assumed. My
assumption<br>
involves about 3 per cent. of uranium. I know of no analyses<br>
ascribing so great an amount of uranium to zircon. The
variety<br>
cyrtolite has been found to contain half this amount, about.
But<br>
even if we doubled our estimate of radium content, the
remarkable<br>
nature of our conclusions is hardly lessened.</p>
<p>It may appear strange that the ever-interesting question of
the<br>
Earth's age should find elucidation from the</p>
<p>238</p>
<p>study of haloes. Nevertheless the subjects are closely
connected.<br>
The circumstances are as follows. Geologists have estimated
the<br>
age of the Earth since denudation began, by measurements of
the<br>
integral effects of denudation. These methods agree in showing
an<br>
age of about rob years. On the other hand, measurements have
been<br>
made of the accumulation in minerals of radioactive
_d&eacute;bris_&mdash;the<br>
helium and lead&mdash;and results obtained which, although they
do not<br>
agree very well among themselves, are concordant in assigning
a<br>
very much greater age to the rocks. If the radioactive
estimate<br>
is correct, then we are now living in a time when the
denudative<br>
forces of the Earth are about eight or nine times as active
as<br>
they have been on the average over the past. Such a state of<br>
things is absolutely unaccountable. And all the more<br>
unaccountable because from all we know we would expect a
somewhat<br>
_lesser_ rate of solvent denudation as the world gets older and
the<br>
land gets more and more loaded with the washed-out materials
of<br>
the rocks.</p>
<p>Both the methods referred to of finding the age assume the<br>
principle of uniformity. The geologist contends for
uniformity<br>
throughout the past physical history of the Earth. The
physicist<br>
claims the like for the change-rates of the radioactive
elements.<br>
Now the study of the rocks enables us to infer something as
to<br>
the past history of our Globe. Nothing is, on the other hand,<br>
known respecting the origin of uranium or thorium&mdash;the
parent<br>
radioactive bodies. And while not questioning the law</p>
<p>239</p>
<p>and regularity which undoubtedly prevail in the periods of
the<br>
members of the radioactive families, it appears to me that it
is<br>
allowable to ask if the change rate of uranium has been
always<br>
what we now believe it to be. This comes to much the same
thing<br>
as supposing that atoms possessing a faster change rate once
were<br>
associated with it which were capable of yielding both helium
and<br>
lead to the rocks. Such atoms might have been collateral in<br>
origin with uranium from some antecedent element. Like
helium,<br>
lead may be a derivative from more than one sequence of<br>
radioactive changes. In the present state of our knowledge
the<br>
possibilities are many. The rate of change is known to be<br>
connected with the range of the alpha ray expelled by the<br>
transforming element; and the conformity of the halo with our<br>
existing knowledge of the ranges is reason for assuming that,<br>
whatever the origin of the more active associate of uranium,
this<br>
passed through similar elemental changes in the progress of
its<br>
disintegration. There may, however, have been differences in
the<br>
ranges which the halo would not reveal. It is remarkable that<br>
uranium at the present time is apparently responsible for two<br>
alpha rays of very different ranges. If these proceed from<br>
different elements, one should be faster in its change rate
than<br>
the other. Some guidance may yet be forthcoming from the study
of<br>
the more obscure problems of radioactivity.</p>
<p>Now it is not improbable that the halo may contribute directly
to<br>
this discussion. We can evidently attack</p>
<p>240</p>
<p>the biotite with a known number of alpha rays and determine
how<br>
many are required to produce a certain intensity of
darkening,<br>
corresponding to that of a halo with a nucleus of measurable<br>
dimensions. On certain assumptions, which are correct within<br>
defined limits, we can calculate, as I have done above, the<br>
number of rays concerned in forming the halo. In doing so we<br>
assume some value for the age of the halo. Let us take the<br>
maximum radioactive value. A halo originating in Devonian
times<br>
may attain a certain central blackening from the effects of,
say,<br>
rob rays. But now suppose we find that we cannot produce the
same<br>
degree of blackening with this number of rays applied in the<br>
laboratory. What are we to conclude? I think there is only
the<br>
one conclusion open to us; that some other source of alpha
rays,<br>
or a faster rate of supply, existed in the past. And this<br>
conclusion would explain the absence of haloes from the
younger<br>
rocks; which, in view of the vast range of effects possible
in<br>
the development of haloes, is, otherwise, not easy to account<br>
for. It is apparent that the experiment on the biotite has a<br>
direct bearing on the validity of the radioactive method of<br>
estimating the age of the rocks. It is now being carried out
by<br>
Professor Rutherford under reliable conditions.</p>
<p>Finally, there is one very certain and valuable fact to be<br>
learned from the halo. The halo has established the extreme<br>
rarity of radioactivity as an atomic phenomenon. One and all
of<br>
the speculations as to</p>
<p>241</p>
<p>the slow breakdown of the commoner elements may be dismissed.
The<br>
halo shows that the mica of the rocks is radioactively
sensitive.<br>
The fundamental criterion of radioactive change is the
expulsion<br>
of the alpha ray. The molecular system of the mica and of
many<br>
other minerals is unstable in presence of these rays, just as
a<br>
photographic plate is unstable in presence of light.
Moreover,<br>
the mineral integrates the radioactive effects in the same way
as<br>
a photographic salt integrates the effects of light. In both<br>
cases the feeblest activities become ultimately apparent to
our<br>
inspection. We have seen that one ray in each year since the<br>
Devonian period will build the fully formed halo: an object<br>
unlike any other appearance in the rocks. And we have been
able<br>
to allocate all the haloes so far investigated to one or the<br>
other of the known radioactive families. We are evidently<br>
justified in the belief that had other elements been
radioactive<br>
we must either find characteristic haloes produced by them,
or<br>
else find a complete darkening of the mica. The feeblest
alpha<br>
rays emitted by the relatively enormous quantities of the<br>
prevailing elements, acting over the whole duration of
geological<br>
time&mdash;and it must be remembered that the haloes we have
been<br>
studying are comparatively young&mdash;must have registered
their<br>
effects on the sensitive minerals. And thus we are safe in<br>
concluding that the common elements, and, indeed, many which<br>
would be called rare, are possessed of a degree of stability<br>
which has preserved them un</p>
<p>242</p>
<p>changed since the beginning of geological time. Each
unaffected<br>
flake of mica is, thus, unassailable proof of a fact which
but<br>
for the halo would, probably, have been for ever beyond our<br>
cognisance.</p>
<p><u>THE USE OF RADIUM IN MEDICINE</u> [1]</p>
<p>IT has been unfortunate for the progress of the
radioactive<br>
treatment of disease that its methods and claims involve much
of<br>
the marvellous. Up till recently, indeed, a large part of<br>
radioactive therapeutics could only be described as bordering
on<br>
the occult. It is not surprising that when, in addition to
its<br>
occult and marvellous characters, claims were made on its
behalf<br>
which in many cases could not be supported, many medical men
came<br>
to regard it with a certain amount of suspicion.</p>
<p>Today, I believe, we are in a better position. I think it
is<br>
possible to ascribe a rational scientific basis to its
legitimate<br>
claims, and to show, in fact, that in radioactive treatment
we<br>
are pursuing methods which have been already tried
extensively<br>
and found to be of definite value; and that new methods
differ<br>
from the old mainly in their power and availability, and
little,<br>
or not at all, in kind.</p>
<p>Let us briefly review the basis of the science. Radium is
a<br>
metallic element chemically resembling barium. It</p>
<p>[1] A Lecture to Postgraduate Students of Medicine in
connection<br>
with the founding of the Dublin Radium Institute, delivered
in<br>
the School of Physic in Ireland, Trinity College, on October
2nd,<br>
1914</p>
<p>244</p>
<p>possesses, however, a remarkable property which barium does
not.<br>
Its atoms are not equally stable. In a given quantity of radium
a<br>
certain very small percentage of the total number of atoms<br>
present break up per second. By "breaking up" we mean their<br>
transmutation to another element. Radium, which is a solid<br>
element under ordinary conditions, gives rise by transmutation
to<br>
a gaseous element&mdash;the emanation of radium. The new element
is a<br>
heavy gas at ordinary temperatures and, like other gases, can
be<br>
liquified by extreme cold. The extraordinary property of<br>
transmutation is entirely automatic. No influence which
chemist<br>
or physicist can apply can affect the rate of transformation.</p>
<p>The emanation inherits the property of instability, but in
its<br>
case the instability is more pronounced. A relatively large<br>
fraction of its atoms transmute per second to a solid element<br>
designated Radium A. In turn this new generation of atoms
breaks<br>
up&mdash;even faster than the emanation&mdash;becoming yet
another element<br>
with specific chemical properties. And so on for a whole
sequence<br>
of transmutations, till finally a stable substance is formed,<br>
identical with ordinary lead in chemical and physical
properties,<br>
but possessing a slightly lower atomic weight.</p>
<p>The genealogy of the radium series of elements shows that
radium<br>
is not the starting point. It possesses ancestors which have
been<br>
traced back to the element uranium.</p>
<p>Now what bearing has this series of transmutations</p>
<p>245</p>
<p>upon medical science? Radium or emanation, &amp;c., are not in
the<br>
Pharmacopoeia as are, say, arsenic or bismuth. The whole<br>
medicinal value of these elements resides in the very
wonderful<br>
phenomena of their radiations. They radiate in the process of<br>
transmuting.</p>
<p>The changing atom may radiate a part of its own mass. The<br>
"alpha"-ray (a-ray) is such a material ray. It is an
electrified<br>
helium atom cast out of the parent atom with enormous<br>
velocity&mdash;such a velocity as would carry it, if not impeded,
all<br>
round the earth in two seconds. All alpha-rays are positively<br>
electrified atoms of the element helium, which thereby is
shown<br>
to be an integral constituent of many elements. The alpha-ray
is<br>
not of much value to medical science, for, in spite of its
great<br>
velocity, it is soon stopped by encounter with other atoms.
It<br>
can penetrate only a minute fraction of a millimetre into<br>
ordinary soft tissues. We shall not further consider it.</p>
<p>Transmuting atoms give out also material rays of another
kind:<br>
the &szlig;-rays. The &szlig;-ray is in mass but a very small
fraction of,<br>
even, a hydrogen atom. Its speed may approach that of light.
As<br>
cast out by radioactive elements it starts with speeds which
vary<br>
with the element, and may be from one-third to nine-tenths
the<br>
velocity of light. The &szlig;-ray is negatively electrified. It
has<br>
long been known to science as the electron. It is also
identical<br>
with the cathode ray of the vacuum tube.</p>
<p>246</p>
<p>Another and quite different kind of radiation is given out
by<br>
many of the transmuting elements:&mdash;the y-ray. This is
not<br>
material, it is ethereal. It is known now with certainty that
the<br>
y-ray is in kind identical with light, but of very much
shorter<br>
wave length than even the extreme ultraviolet light of the
solar<br>
spectrum. The y-ray is flashed from the transmuting atom
along<br>
with the &szlig;-ray. It is identical in character with the x-ray
but<br>
of even shorter wave length.</p>
<p>There is a very interesting connection between the y-ray and
the<br>
&szlig;-ray which it is important for the medical man to
understand&mdash;as<br>
far as it is practicable on our present knowledge.</p>
<p>When y-rays or x-rays fall on matter they give rise to
&szlig;-rays.<br>
The mechanism involved is not known but it is possibly a
result<br>
of the resonance of the atom, or of parts of it, to the short<br>
light waves. And it is remarkable that the y-rays which, as
we<br>
have seen, are shorter and more penetrating waves than the<br>
x-rays, give rise to &szlig;-rays possessed of greater velocity
and<br>
penetration than &szlig;-rays excited by the x-rays. Indeed the
&szlig;-rays<br>
originated by y-rays may attain a velocity nearly approaching<br>
that of light and as great as that of any &szlig;-rays emitted
by<br>
transmuting atoms. Again there is demonstrable evidence that<br>
&szlig;-rays impinging on matter may give rise to y-rays. The
most<br>
remarkable demonstration of this is seen in the x-ray tube.
Here<br>
the x-rays originate where the stream of &szlig;- or
cathode-rays</p>
<p>247</p>
<p>are arrested on the anode. But the first relation is at
present<br>
of most importance to us&mdash;_i.e._ that the y-or x-rays give
rise to<br>
&szlig;-rays.</p>
<p>This relation gives us additional evidence of the identity of
the<br>
physical effects of y-, x-, and light-rays &mdash;using the term
light<br>
rays in the usual sense of spectral rays. For it has long
been<br>
known that light waves liberate electrons from atoms. It has
been<br>
found that these electrons possess a certain initial velocity<br>
which is the greater the shorter the wave length of the light<br>
concerned in their liberation. The whole science of<br>
"photo-electricity" centres round this phenomenon. The action
of<br>
light on the photographic plate, as well as many other
physical<br>
and chemical phenomena, find an explanation in this liberation
of<br>
the electron by the light wave.</p>
<p>Here, then, we have spectral light waves liberating<br>
electrons&mdash;_i.e._ very minute negatively-charged particles,
and we<br>
find that, as we use shorter light waves, the initial velocity
of<br>
these particles increases. Again, we have x-rays which are
far<br>
smaller in wave length than spectral light, liberating much<br>
faster negatively electrified particles. Finally, we have<br>
y-rays&mdash;the shortest nether waves of all-liberating
negative<br>
particles of the highest velocity known. Plainly the whole
series<br>
of phenomena is continuous.</p>
<p>We can now look closer at the actions involved in the
therapeutic<br>
influence of the several rays and in</p>
<p>248</p>
<p>this way, also, see further the correlation between what may
be<br>
called photo-therapeutics and radioactive therapeutics.</p>
<p>The &szlig;-ray, whether we obtain it directly from the
transforming<br>
radioactive atom or whether we obtain it as a result of the<br>
effects of the y- or x-rays upon the atom, is an ionising
agent<br>
of wonderful power. What is meant by this? In its physical
aspect<br>
this means that the atoms through which it passes acquire
free<br>
electric charges; some becoming positive, some negative. This
can<br>
only be due to the loss of an electron by the affected atom.
The<br>
loss of the small negative charge carried in the electron
leaves<br>
the atom positively electrified or creates a positive ion.
The<br>
fixing of the wandering electron to a neutral atom creates a<br>
negative ion. Before further consideration of the importance
of<br>
the phenomenon of ionisation we must fix in our minds that
the<br>
agent, which brings this about, is the &szlig;-ray. There is
little<br>
evidence that the y-ray can directly create ions to any large<br>
extent. But the action of liberating high-speed &szlig;-rays
results in<br>
the creation of many thousands of ions by each &szlig;-ray
liberated.<br>
As an agent in the hands of the medical man we must regard
the<br>
y-ray as a light wave of extremely penetrating character,
which<br>
creates high-speed &szlig;-rays in the tissues which it
penetrates,<br>
these &szlig;-rays being most potent ionising agents. The
&szlig;-rays<br>
directly obtained from radioactive atoms assist in the work
of<br>
ionisation. &szlig;-rays do not</p>
<p>249</p>
<p>penetrate far from their source. The fastest of them would
not<br>
probably penetrate one centimetre in soft tissues.</p>
<p>We must now return to the phenomenon of ionisation. Ionisation
is<br>
revealed to observation most conspicuously when it takes place
in<br>
a gas. The + and - electric charges on the gas particles endow
it<br>
with the properties of a conductor of electricity, the + ions<br>
moving freely in one direction and the - ions in the opposite<br>
direction under an electric potential. But there are effects<br>
brought about by ionisation of more importance to the medical
man<br>
than this. The chemist has long come to recognise that in the
ion<br>
he is concerned with the inner mechanism of a large number of<br>
chemical phenomena. For with the electrification of the atom<br>
attractive and repulsive forces arise. We can directly show
the<br>
chemical effects of the ionising &szlig;-rays. Water exposed to
their<br>
bombardment splits up into hydrogen and oxygen. And, again,
the<br>
separated atoms may be in part recombined under the influence
of<br>
the radiation. Ammonia splits up into hydrogen and nitrogen.<br>
Carbon dioxide forms carbon, carbon monoxide, and oxygen;<br>
hydrochloric acid forms chlorine and hydrogen. In these
cases,<br>
also, recombination can be partially effected by the rays.</p>
<p>We can be quite sure that within the complex structure of
the<br>
living cell the ionising effects which everywhere accompany
the<br>
&szlig;-rays must exert a profound influence. The sequence of
chemical<br>
events which as yet seem</p>
<p>250</p>
<p>beyond the ken of science and which are involved in
metabolism<br>
cannot fail to be affected. Any, it is not surprising that as
the<br>
result of eaperinient it is found that the radiations are
agents<br>
which may be used either for the stimulation of the natural<br>
events of growth or used for the actual destruction of the
cell.<br>
It is easy to see that the feeble radiation should produce
the<br>
one effect, the strong the other. In a similar way by a
moderate<br>
light stimulus we create the latent image in the photographic<br>
plate; by an intense light we again destroy this image. The
inner<br>
mechanism in this last case can be logically stated.[1]</p>
<p>_There is plainly a true physical basis here for the efficacy
of<br>
radioactive treatment and, what is more, we find when we
examine<br>
it, that it is in kind not different from that underlying<br>
treatment by spectral radiations. But in degree it is very<br>
different and here is the reason for the special importance
of<br>
radioactivity as a therapeutic agent._ The Finsen light is
capable<br>
of influencing the soft tissues to a short depth only. The
reason<br>
is that the wave length of the light used is too great to
pass<br>
without rapid absorption through the tissues; and, further,
the<br>
electrons it gives rise to&mdash;_i.e._ the &szlig;-rays it
liberates&mdash;are too<br>
slow-moving to be very efficient ionisers. X-rays penetrate
in<br>
some cases quite freely and give rise to much faster and more<br>
powerful &szlig;-rays</p>
<p>[1] See _The Latent Image_, p. 202.</p>
<p>251</p>
<p>than can the Finsen light. But far more penetrating than
x-rays<br>
are the y-rays emitted in certain of the radioactive changes.<br>
These give rise to &szlig;-rays having a velocity approximate to
that<br>
of light.</p>
<p>The y-rays are, therefore, very penetrating and powerfully<br>
ionising light waves; light waves which are quite invisible
to<br>
the eye and can beam right through the tissues of the body.
To<br>
the mind's eye only are they visible. And a very wonderful<br>
picture they make. We see the transmuting atom flashing out
this<br>
light for an inconceivably short instant as it throws off the<br>
&szlig;-ray. And "so far this little candle throws his beams" in
the<br>
complex system of the cells, so far atoms shaken by the rays
send<br>
out &szlig;-rays; these in turn are hurled against other
atomic<br>
systems; fresh separations of electrons arise and new
attractions<br>
and repulsions spring up and the most important chemical
changes<br>
are brought about. Our mental picture can claim to be no more<br>
than diagrammatic of the reality. Still we are here dealing
with<br>
recognised physical and chemical phenomena, and their
description<br>
as "occult" in the derogatory sense is certainly not<br>
justifiable.</p>
<p>Having now briefly reviewed the nature of the rays arising
in<br>
radioactive substances and the rationale of their influence,
we<br>
must turn to more especially practical considerations.</p>
<p>The Table given opposite shows that radium itself is
responsible<br>
for a- and &szlig;-rays only. It happens that</p>

Uranium-radium family, the character of their radiations and<br>

<p>253</p>
<p>the &szlig;-rays emitted by radium are very
"soft"&mdash;_i.e._ slow and<br>
easily absorbed. The a-ray is in no case available for more
than<br>
mere surface application. Hence we see that, contrary to what
is<br>
generally believed, radium itself is of little direct
therapeutic<br>
value. Nor is the next body in succession&mdash;the emanation,
for it<br>
gives only a-rays. In fact, to be brief, it is not till we
come<br>
to Radium B that &szlig;-rays of a relatively high penetrative
quality<br>
are reached; and it is not till we come to Radium C that
highly<br>
penetrative y-rays are obtained.</p>
<p>It is around this element, Radium C, that the chief
medical<br>
importance of radioactive treatment by this family of
radioactive<br>
bodies centres. Not only are &szlig;-rays of Radium C very
penetrating,<br>
but the y-rays are perhaps the most energetic rays of the,
kind<br>
known. Further in the list there is no very special medical<br>
interest.</p>
<p>Now, how can we get a supply of this valuable element Radium
C?<br>
We can obtain it from radium itself. For even if radium has
been<br>
deprived of its emanation (which is easily done by heating it
or<br>
bringing it into solution) in a few weeks we get back the
Radium<br>
C. One thing here we must be clear about. With a given
quantity<br>
of Radium only a certain definitely limited amount of Radium
C,<br>
or of emanation, or any other of the derived bodies, will be<br>
associated. Why is this? The answer is because the several<br>
successive elements are themselves decaying &mdash;_i.e._
changing one<br>
into the other. The atomic per-</p>
<p>254</p>
<p>centage of each, which decays in a second, is a fixed
quantity<br>
which we cannot alter. Now if we picture radium which has
been<br>
completely deprived of its emanation, again accumulating by<br>
automatic transmutation a fresh store of this element, we have
to<br>
remember:&mdash; (i) That the rate of creation of emanation by
the<br>
radium is practically constant; and (2) that the absolute
amount<br>
of the emanation decaying per second increases as the stock
of<br>
emanation increases. Finally, when the amount of accumulated<br>
emanation has increased to such an extent that the number of<br>
emanation atoms transmuting per second becomes exactly equal
to<br>
the number being generated per second, the amount of
emanation<br>
present cannot increase. This is called the equilibrium
amount.<br>
If fifteen members are elected steadily each year into a<br>
newly-founded society the number of members will increase for
the<br>
first few years; finally, when the losses by death of the
members<br>
equal about fifteen per annum the society can get no bigger.
It<br>
has attained the equilibrium number of members.</p>
<p>This applies to every one of the successive elements. It
takes<br>
twenty-one days for the equilibrium quantity of emanation to
be<br>
formed in radium which has been completely de-emanated; and
it<br>
takes 3.8 days for half the equilibrium amount to be formed.<br>
Again, if we start with a stock of emanation it takes just
three<br>
hours for the equilibrium amount of Radium C to be formed.</p>
<p>255</p>
<p>We can evidently grow Radium C either from radium itself or
from<br>
the emanation of radium. If we use a tube of radium we have
an<br>
almost perfectly constant quantity of Radium C present, for
as<br>
fast as the Radium C and intervening elements decay the
Radium,<br>
which only diminishes very slowly in amount, makes up the
loss.<br>
But, if we start off with a tube of emanation, we do not
possess<br>
a constant supply of Radium C, because the emanation is
decaying<br>
fairly rapidly and there is no radium to make good its loss.
In<br>
3.8 days about one half the emanation is transmuted and the<br>
Radium C decreases proportionately and, of course, with the<br>
Radium C the valuable radiations also decrease. In another
3.8<br>
days&mdash;that is in about a week from the start&mdash;the
radioactive value<br>
of the tube has fallen to one-fourth of its original value.</p>
<p>But in spite of the inconstant character of the emanation
tube<br>
there are many reasons for preferring its use to the use of
the<br>
radium tube. Chief of these is the fact that we can keep the<br>
precious radium safely locked up in the laboratory and not<br>
exposed to the thousand-and-one risks of the hospital. Then,<br>
secondly, the emanation, being a gas, is very convenient for<br>
subdivision into a large number of very small tubes according
to<br>
the dosage required.</p>
<p>In fact the volume of the emanation is exceedingly minute.
The<br>
amount of emanation in equilibrium with one gramme of radium
is<br>
called the curie, and with one</p>
<p>256</p>
<p>milligramme the millicurie. Now, the volume of the curie is
only<br>
a little more than one half a cubic millimetre. Hence in
dealing<br>
with emanation from twenty or forty milligrammes of radium we
are<br>
dealing with very small volumes.</p>
<p>How may the emanation be obtained? The process is an easy one
in<br>
skilled and practised hands. The salt of radium&mdash;generally
the<br>
bromide or chloride&mdash;is brought into acid solution. This
causes<br>
the emanation to be freely given off as fast as it is formed.
At<br>
intervals we pump it off with a mercury pump.</p>
<p>Let us see how many millicuries we will in future be able to
turn<br>
out in the week in our new Dublin Radium Institute.[1] We
shall<br>
have about 130 milligrammes of radium. In 3.8 days we get 65<br>
millicuries from this&mdash;_i.e._ half the equilibrium amount of
130<br>
millicuries. Hence in the week, we shall have about 130<br>
millicuries.</p>
<p>This is not much. Many experts consider this little enough
for<br>
one tube. But here in Dublin we have been using the emanation
in<br>
a more economical and effective manner than is the usage<br>
elsewhere; according to a method which has been worked out
and<br>
developed in our own Radium Institute. The economy is obtained
by<br>
the very simple expedient of minutely subdividing the' dose.
The<br>
system in vogue, generally, is to treat the tumour by
inserting<br>
into it one or two very active</p>
<p>[1] Then recently established by the Royal Dublin Society.</p>
<p>257</p>
<p>tubes, containing, perhaps, up to 200 millicuries, or even
more,<br>
per tube. Now these very heavily charged tubes give a
radiation<br>
so intense at points close to the tube, due to the greater<br>
density of the rays near the tube, and, also, to the action
of<br>
the softer and more easily absorbable rays, that it has been<br>
found necessary to stop these softer rays&mdash;both the y and
&szlig;&mdash;by<br>
wrapping lead or platinum round the tube. In this lead or<br>
platinum some thirty per cent. or more of the rays is
absorbed<br>
and, of course, wasted. But in the absence of the screen there
is<br>
extensive necrosis of the tissues near the tubes.</p>
<p>If, however, in place of one or two such tubes we use ten
or<br>
twenty, each containing one-tenth or one-twentieth of the
dose,<br>
we can avail ourselves of the softer rays around each tube
with<br>
benefit. Thus a wasteful loss is avoided. Moreover a more
uniform<br>
"illumination" of the tissues results, just as we can
illuminate<br>
a hall more uniformly by the use of many lesser centres of
light<br>
than by the use of one intense centre of radiation. Also we
get<br>
what is called "cross-radiation,"which is found to be
beneficial.<br>
The surgeon knows far better what he is doing by this method.<br>
Thus it may be arranged for the effects to go on with
approximate<br>
uniformity throughout the tumour instead of varying rapidly<br>
around a central point or&mdash;and this may be very
important&mdash; the<br>
effects may be readily concentrated locally.</p>
<p>Finally, not the least of the benefit arises in the easy<br>
technique of this new method. The quantities of</p>
<p>258</p>
<p>emanation employed can fit in the finest capillary glass
tubing<br>
and the hairlike tubes can in turn be placed in fine
exploring<br>
needles. There is comparatively little inconvenience to the<br>
patient in inserting these needles, and there is the most
perfect<br>
control of the dosage in the number and strength of these
tubes<br>
and the duration of exposure.[1]</p>
<p>The first Radium Institute in Ireland has already done good
work<br>
for the relief of human suffering. It will have, I hope, a
great<br>
future before it, for I venture, with diffidence, to hold the<br>
opinion, that with increased study the applications and claims
of<br>
radioactive treatment will increase.</p>

<p><u>SKATING</u> [1]</p>
<p>IT is now many years ago since, as a student, I was present at
a<br>
college lecture delivered by a certain learned professor on
the<br>
subject of friction. At this lecture a discussion arose out of
a<br>
question addressed to our teacher: "How is it we can skate on
ice<br>
and on no other substance?"</p>
<p>The answer came back without hesitation: "Because the ice is
so<br>
smooth."</p>
<p>It was at once objected: "But you can skate on ice which is
not<br>
smooth."</p>
<p>This put the professor in a difficulty. Obviously it is not
on<br>
account of the smoothness of the ice. A piece of polished
plate<br>
glass is far smoother than a surface of ice after the latter
is<br>
cut up by a day's skating. Nevertheless, on the scratched and<br>
torn ice-surface skating is still quite possible; on the
smooth<br>
plate glass we know we could not skate.</p>
<p>Some little time after this discussion, the connection
between<br>
skating and a somewhat abstruse fact in physical science
occurred<br>
to me. As the fact itself is one which has played a part in
the<br>
geological history of the earth,</p>
<p>[1] A lecture delivered before the Royal Dublin Society in
1905.</p>
<p>260</p>
<p>and a part of no little importance, the subject of
skating,<br>
whereby it is perhaps best brought home to every one, is<br>
deserving of our careful attention. Let not, then, the title
of<br>
this lecture mislead the reader as to the importance of its<br>
subject matter.</p>
<p>Before going on to the explanation of the wonderful freedom
of<br>
the skater's movements, I wish to verify what I have inferred
as<br>
to the great difference in the slipperiness of glass and the<br>
slipperiness of ice. Here is a slab of polished glass. I can<br>
raise it to any angle I please so that at length this brass<br>
weight of 250 grams just slips down when started with a
slight<br>
shove. The angle is, as you see, about 12&frac12; degrees. I
now<br>
transfer the weight on to this large slab of ice which I
first<br>
rapidly dry with soft linen. Observe that the weight slips
down<br>
the surface of ice at a much lower angle. It is a very low
angle<br>
indeed: I read it as between 4 and 5 degrees. We see by this<br>
experiment that there is a great difference between the<br>
slipperiness of the two surfaces as measured by what is
called<br>
"the angle of friction." In this experiment, too, the glass<br>
possesses by far the smoother surface although I have rubbed
the<br>
deeper rugosities out of the ice by smoothing it with a glass<br>
surface. Notwithstanding this, its surface is spotted with
small<br>
cavities due to bubbles and imperfections. It is certain that
if<br>
the glass was equally rough, its angle of friction towards
the<br>
brass weight would be higher.</p>
<p>261</p>
<p>We have, however, another comparative experiment to carry out.
I<br>
made as you saw a determination of the angle at which this
weight<br>
of 250 grams just slipped on the ice. The lower surface of
the<br>
weight, the part which presses on the ice, consists of a
light,<br>
brass curtain ring. This can be detached. Its mass is only
6&frac12;<br>
grams, the curtain ring being, in fact, hollow and made of
very<br>
thin metal. We have, therefore, in it a very small weight
which<br>
presents exactly the same surface beneath as did the weight
of<br>
250 grams. You see, now, that this light weight will not slip
on<br>
ice at 5 or 6 degrees of slope, but first does so at about io<br>
degrees.</p>
<p>This is a very important experiment as regards our present<br>
inquiry. Ice appears to possess more than one angle of
friction<br>
according as a heavy or a light weight is used to press upon
it.<br>
We will make the same experiment with the plate of glass. You
see<br>
that there is little or no difference in the angle of friction
of<br>
brass on glass when we press the surfaces together with a
heavy<br>
or with a light weight. The light weight requires the same
slope<br>
of 12&frac12; degrees to make it slip.</p>
<p>This last result is in accordance with the laws of friction.
We<br>
say that when solid presses on solid, for each pair of
substances<br>
pressed together there is a constant ratio between the force<br>
required to keep one in motion over the other, and the force<br>
pressing the solids together. This ratio is called"the<br>
coefficient of friction."The coefficient is, in fact, constant
or<br>
approximately</p>
<p>262</p>
<p>so. I can determine the coefficient of friction from the angle
of<br>
friction by taking the tangent of the angle. The tangent of
the<br>
angle of friction is the coefficient of friction. If, then,
the<br>
coefficient is constant, so, of course, must the angle of<br>
friction be constant. We have seen that it is so in the case
of<br>
metal on glass, but not so in the case of metal on ice. This<br>
curious result shows that there is something abnormal about
the<br>
slipperiness of ice.</p>
<p>The experiments we have hitherto made are open to the
reproach<br>
that the surface of the ice is probably damp owing to the
warmth<br>
of the air in contact with it. I have here a means of dealing<br>
with a surface of cold, dry ice. This shallow copper tank
about<br>
18 inches (45 cms.) long, and 4 inches (10 cms.) wide, is
filled<br>
with a freezing 'mixture circulated through it from a larger<br>
vessel containing ice melting in hydrochloric acid at a<br>
temperature of about -18&deg; C. This keeps the tank below
the<br>
melting point of ice. The upper surface of the tank is
provided<br>
with raised edges so that it can be flooded with water. The
water<br>
is now frozen and its temperature is below 0&deg; C. It is
about<br>
10&deg; C. I can place over the ice a roof-shaped cover made of
two<br>
inclined slabs of thick plate glass. This acts to keep out
warm<br>
air, and to do away with any possibility of the surface of
the<br>
ice being wet with water thawed from the ice. The whole tank<br>
along with its roof of glass can be adjusted to any angle, and
a,<br>
scale at the</p>
<p>263</p>
<p>raised end of the tank gives the angle of slope in degrees.
A<br>
weight placed on the ice can be easily seen through the glass<br>
cover.</p>
<p>The weight we shall use consists of a very light ring of<br>
aluminium wire which is rendered plainly visible by a
ping-pong<br>
ball attached above it. The weight rests now on a copper
plate<br>
provided for the purpose at the upper end of the tank. The
plate<br>
being in direct contact beneath with the freezing mixture we
are<br>
sure that the aluminium ring is no hotter than the ice. A
light<br>
jerk suffices to shake the weight on to the surface of the
ice.</p>
<p>We find that this ring loaded with only the ping-pong ball,
and<br>
weighing a total of 2.55 grams does not slip at the low angles.
I<br>
have the surface of the ice at an angle of rather over
13&frac12;, and<br>
only by continuous tapping of the apparatus can it be induced
to<br>
slip down. This is a coefficient of 0.24, and compares with
the<br>
coefficient of hard and smooth solids on one another. I now<br>
replace the empty ping-pong ball by a similar ball filled
with<br>
lead shot. The total weight is now 155 grams. You see the
angle<br>
of slipping has fallen to 7&deg;.</p>
<p>Every one who has made friction experiments knows how<br>
unsatisfactory and inconsistent they often are. We can only<br>
discuss notable quantities and broad results, unless the most<br>
conscientious care be taken to eliminate errors. The net
result<br>
here is that ice at about -10&deg; C. when pressed on by a very
light<br>
weight possesses a</p>
<p>264</p>
<p>coefficient of friction comparable with the usual coefficients
of<br>
solids on solids, but when the pressure is increased, the<br>
coefficient falls to about half this value.</p>
<p>The following table embodies some results obtained on the<br>
friction of ice and glass, using the methods I have shown you.

<p>You perceive from the table that while the friction of brass
or<br>
aluminium on glass is quite independent of the weight used,
that<br>
of brass or aluminium on ice depends in some way upon the
weight,<br>
and falls in a very marked degree when the weight is heavy.
Now,<br>
I think that if we had been on the look out for any
abnormality<br>
in the friction of hard substances on ice, we would have
rather<br>
anticipated a variation in the</p>
<p>265</p>
<p>other direction. We would have, perhaps, expected that a
heavy<br>
weight would have given rise to the greater friction. I now
turn<br>
to the explanation of this extraordinary result.</p>
<p>You are aware that it requires an expenditure of heat merely
to<br>
convert ice to water, the water produced being at the
temperature<br>
of the ice, _i.e._ at 0&deg; C., from which it is derived. The
heat<br>
required to change the ice from the solid to the liquid state
is<br>
the latent heat of water. We take the unit quantity of heat to
be<br>
that which is required to heat 1 kilogram of water 1&deg; C. Then
if<br>
we melt 1 kilogram of ice, we must supply it with 80 such
units<br>
of heat. While melting is going on, there is no change of<br>
temperature if the experiment is carefully conducted. The
melting<br>
ice and the water coming from it remain at 0&deg; C. throughout
the<br>
operation, and neither the thermometer nor your own
sensations<br>
would tell you of the amount of heat which was flowing in.
The<br>
heat is latent or hidden in the liquid produced, and has gone
to<br>
do molecular work in the substance. Observe that if we supply<br>
only 40 thermal units, we get only one-half the ice melted.
If<br>
only 10 units are supplied, then we get only one eighth of a<br>
kilogram of water, and no more nor less.</p>
<p>I have ventured to recall to you these commonplaces of
science<br>
before considering a mode of melting ice which is less
generally<br>
known, and which involves no supply of heat on your part.
This<br>
method involves for its</p>
<p>266</p>
<p>understanding a careful consideration of the thermal
properties<br>
of water in the solid state.</p>
<p>It must have been observed a very long time ago that water<br>
expands when it freezes. Otherwise ice would not float on
water;<br>
and, what is perhaps more important in your eyes, your water<br>
pipes would not burst in winter when the water freezes
therein.<br>
But although the important fact of the expansion of water on<br>
freezing was so long presented to the observation of mankind,
it<br>
was not till almost exactly the middle of the last century
that<br>
James Thomson, a gifted Irishman, predicted many important<br>
consequences arising from the fact of the expansion of water
on<br>
becoming solid. The principles lie enunciated are perfectly<br>
general, and apply in every case of change of volume
attending<br>
change of state. We are here only concerned with the case of<br>
water and ice.</p>
<p>James Thomson, following a train of thought which we cannot
here<br>
pursue, predicted that owing to the fact of the expansion of<br>
water on becoming solid, pressure will lower the melting point
of<br>
ice or the freezing point of water. Normally, as you are
aware,<br>
the temperature is 0&deg; C. or 32&deg; F. Thomson said that this
would<br>
be found to be the freezing point only at atmospheric
pressure.<br>
He calculated how much it would change with change of
pressure.<br>
He predicted that the freezing point would fall 0.0075 of a<br>
degree Centigrade for each additional atmosphere of pressure<br>
applied to the water. Suppose,</p>
<p>267</p>
<p>for instance, our earth possessed an atmosphere so heavy to
as<br>
exert a thousand times the pressure of the existing
atmosphere,<br>
then water would not freeze at 0&deg; C., but at -7.5&deg; C. or
about<br>
18&deg; F. Again, in vacuo, that is when the pressure has
been<br>
reduced to the relatively small vapour pressure of the water,
the<br>
freezing point is above 0&deg; C., _i.e._ at 0.0075&deg; C. In
parts of<br>
the ocean depths the pressure is much over a thousand<br>
atmospheres. Fresh water would remain liquid there at<br>
temperatures much below 0&deg; C.</p>
<p>It will be evident enough, even to those not possessed of
the<br>
scientific insight of James Thomson, that some such fact is to
be<br>
anticipated. It is, however, easy to be wise after the event.
It<br>
appeals to us in a general way that as water expands on
freezing,<br>
pressure will tend to resist the turning of it to ice. The
water<br>
will try to remain liquid in obedience to the pressure. It
will,<br>
therefore, require a lower temperature to induce it to become<br>
ice.</p>
<p>James Thomson left his thesis as a prediction. But he
predicted<br>
exactly what his distinguished brother, Sir William
Thomson&mdash;later<br>
Lord Kelvin&mdash;found to happen when the matter was put to the
test<br>
of experiment. We must consider the experiment made by Lord<br>
Kelvin.</p>
<p>According to Thomson's views, if a quantity of ice and water
are<br>
compressed, there must be _a fall of temperature_. The nature
of<br>
his argument is as follows:</p>
<p>268</p>
<p>Let the ice and water be exactly at 0&deg; C. to start with.
Then<br>
suppose we apply, say, one thousand atmospheres pressure. The<br>
melting point of the ice is lowered to -7.5&deg; C. That is, it
will<br>
require a temperature so low as -7.5&deg; C. to keep it solid.
It<br>
will therefore at once set about melting, for as we have
seen,<br>
its actual temperature is not -7.5&deg; C., but a higher
temperature,<br>
_i.e._ 0&deg; C. In other words, it is 7.5&deg; above its melting
point.<br>
But as soon as it begins melting it also begins to absorb heat
to<br>
supply the 80 thermal units which, as we know, are required
to<br>
turn each kilogram of the ice to water. Where can it get this<br>
heat? We assume that we give it none. It has only two
sources,<br>
the ice can take heat from itself, and it can take heat from
the<br>
water. It does both in this case, and both ice and water drop
in<br>
temperature. They fall in temperature till -7.5&deg; is reached.
Then<br>
the ice has got to its melting point under the pressure of
one<br>
thousand atmospheres, or, as we may put it, the water has
reached<br>
its freezing point. There can be no more melting. The whole
mass<br>
is down to -7.5&deg; C., and will stay there if we keep heat
from<br>
flowing either into or out of the vessel. There is now more
water<br>
and less ice in the vessel than when we started, and the<br>
temperature has fallen to -7.5&deg; C. The fall of temperature to
the<br>
amount predicted by the theory was verified by Lord Kelvin.</p>
<p>Suppose we now suddenly remove the pressure; what will happen?
We<br>
have water and ice at -7.5&deg; C.</p>
<p>269</p>
<p>and at the normal pressure. Water at -7.5&deg; and at the
normal<br>
pressure of course turns to ice. The water will, therefore,<br>
instantly freeze in the vessel, and the whole process will be<br>
reversed. In freezing, the water will give up its latent
heat,<br>
and this will warm up the whole mass till once again 0&deg; C.
is<br>
attained. Then there will be no more freezing, for again the
ice<br>
is at its melting point. This is the remarkable series of
events<br>
which James Thomson predicted. And these are the events which<br>
Lord Kelvin by a delicate series of experiments, verified in<br>
every respect.</p>
<p>Suppose we had nothing but solid ice in the vessel at
starting,<br>
would the experiment result in the same way? Yes, it
assuredly<br>
would. The ice under the increased pressure would melt a
little<br>
everywhere throughout its mass, taking the requisite latent
heat<br>
from itself at the expense of its sensible heat, and the<br>
temperature of the ice would fall to the new melting point.</p>
<p>Could we melt the whole of the ice in this manner? Again
the<br>
answer is "yes." But the pressure must be very great. If we<br>
assume that all the heat is obtained at the expense of the<br>
sensible heat of the ice, the cooling must be such as to
supply<br>
the latent heat of the whole mass of water produced. However,
the<br>
latent heat diminishes as the melting point is lowered, and at
a<br>
rate which would reduce it to nothing at about 18,000<br>
atmospheres. Mousson, operating on ice enclosed in a
conducting<br>
cylinder and cooled to -18&deg; at starting</p>
<p>270</p>
<p>appears to have obtained very complete liquefaction. Mousson
must<br>
have attained a pressure of at least an amount adequate to
lower<br>
the melting point below -18&deg;. The degree of liquefaction
actually<br>
attained may have been due in part to the passage of heat
through<br>
the walls of the vessel. He proved the more or less complete<br>
liquefaction of the ice within the vessel by the fall of a
copper<br>
index from the top to the bottom of the vessel while the
pressure<br>
was on.</p>
<p>I have here a simple way of demonstrating to you the fall
of<br>
temperature attending the compression of ice. In this mould,<br>
which is strongly made of steel, lined with boxwood to
diminish<br>
the passage of conducted heat, is a quantity of ice which I<br>
compress when I force in this plunger. In the ice is a<br>
thermoelectric junction, the wires leading to which are in<br>
communication with a reflecting galvanometer. The thermocouple
is<br>
of copper and nickel, and is of such sensitiveness as to show
by<br>
motion of the spot of light on the screen even a small
fraction<br>
of a degree. On applying the pressure, you see the spot of
light<br>
is displaced, and in such a direction as to indicate cooling.
The<br>
balancing thermocouple is all the time imbedded in a block of
ice<br>
so that its temperature remains unaltered. On taking off the<br>
pressure, the spot of light returns to its first position. I
can<br>
move the spot of light backwards and forwards on the screen
by<br>
taking off and putting on the pressure. The effects are quite<br>
instantaneous.</p>
<p>271</p>
<p>The fact last referred to is very important. The ice, in fact,
is<br>
as it were automatically turned to water. It is not a matter
of<br>
the conduction of heat from point to point in the ice. Its
own<br>
sensible heat is immediately absorbed throughout the mass.
This<br>
would be the theoretical result, but it is probable that owing
to<br>
imperfections throughout the ice and failure in uniformity in
the<br>
distribution of the stress, the melting would not take place<br>
quite uniformly or homogeneously.</p>
<p>Before applying our new ideas to skating, I want you to notice
a<br>
fact which I have inferentially stated, but not specifically<br>
mentioned. Pressure will only lead to the melting of ice if
the<br>
new melting point, _i.e._ that due to the pressure, is below
the<br>
prevailing temperature. Let us take figures. The ice to start<br>
with is, say, at -3&deg; C. Suppose we apply such a pressure to
this<br>
ice as will confer a melting point of -2&deg; C. on it.
Obviously,<br>
there will be no melting. For why should ice which is at -3&deg;
C.<br>
melt when its melting point is -2&deg; C.? The ice is, in
fact,<br>
colder than its melting point. Hence, you note this fact: The<br>
pressure must be sufficiently intense to bring the melting
point<br>
below the prevailing temperature, or there will be no
melting;<br>
and the further we reduce the melting point by pressure below
the<br>
prevailing temperature, the more ice will be melted.</p>
<p>We come at length to the object of our remarks I don't know
who<br>
invented skating or skates. It is said that in the thirteenth<br>
century the inhabitants of</p>
<p>272</p>
<p>England used to amuse themselves by fastening the bones of
an<br>
animal beneath their feet, and pushing themselves about on
the<br>
ice by means of a stick pointed with iron. With such skates,
any<br>
performance either on inside or outside edge was impossible.
We<br>
are a conservative people. This exhilarating amusement appears
to<br>
have served the people of England for three centuries. Not
till<br>
1660 were wooden skates shod with iron introduced from the<br>
Netherlands. It is certain that skating was a fashionable<br>
amusement in Pepys' time. He writes in 1662 to the effect:
"It<br>
being a great frost, did see people sliding with their
skates,<br>
which is a very pretty art." It is remarkable that it was the<br>
German poet Klopstock who made skating fashionable in
Germany.<br>
Until his time, the art was considered a pastime, only fit
for<br>
very young or silly people.</p>
<p>I wish now to dwell upon that beautiful contrivance the
modern<br>
skate. It is a remarkable example of how an appliance can
develop<br>
towards perfection in the absence of a really intelligent<br>
understanding of the principles underlying its development.
For<br>
what are the principles underlying the proper construction of
the<br>
skate? After what I have said, I think you will readily<br>
understand. The object is to produce such a pressure under
the<br>
blade that the ice will melt. We wish to establish such a<br>
pressure under the skate that even on a day when the ice is
below<br>
zero, its melting</p>
<p>273</p>
<p>point is so reduced just under the edge of the skate that the
ice<br>
turns to water.</p>
<p>It is this melting of the ice under the skate which secures
the<br>
condition essential to skating. In the first place, the skate
no<br>
longer rests on a solid. It rests on a liquid. You are aware
how<br>
in cases where we want to reduce friction&mdash;say at the
bearing of a<br>
wheel or under a pivot&mdash;we introduce a liquid. Look at
the<br>
bearings of a steam engine. A continuous stream of oil is fed
in<br>
to interpose itself between the solid surfaces. I need not<br>
illustrate so well-known a principle by experiment. Solid<br>
friction disappears when the liquid intervenes. In its place
we<br>
substitute the lesser difficulty of shearing one layer of the<br>
liquid over the other; and if we keep up the supply of oil
the<br>
work required to do this is not very different, no matter how<br>
great we make the pressure upon the bearings. Compared with
the<br>
resistance of solid friction, the resistance of fluid friction
is<br>
trifling. Here under the skate the lubrication is perhaps the<br>
most perfect which it is possible to conceive. J. M&uuml;ller
has<br>
determined the coefficient by towing a skater holding on by a<br>
spring balance. The coefficient is between 0.016 and 0.032.
In<br>
other words, the skater would run down an incline so little as
1<br>
or 2 degrees; an inclination not perceivable by the eye. Now<br>
observe that the larger of these coefficients is almost
exactly<br>
the same as that which Perry found in the case of
well-greased<br>
surfaces. But evidently no</p>
<p>274</p>
<p>artificial system of lubrication could hope to equal that
which<br>
exists between the skate and the ice. For the lubrication
here<br>
is, as it were, automatic. In the machine if the lubricant
gets<br>
squeezed out there instantly ensues solid friction. Under the<br>
skate this cannot happen for the squeezing out of the
lubricant<br>
is instantly followed by the formation of another film of
water.<br>
The conditions of pressure which may lead to solid friction
in<br>
the machine here automatically call the lubricant into<br>
existence.</p>
<p>Just under the edge of the skate the pressure is enormous.<br>
Consider that the whole weight of the skater is born upon a
mere<br>
knife edge. The skater alternately throws his whole weight
upon<br>
the edge of each skate. But not only is the weight thus<br>
concentrated upon one edge, further concentration is secured
in<br>
the best skates by making the skate hollow-ground, _i.e._<br>
increasing the keenness of the edge by making it less than a<br>
right angle. Still greater pressure is obtained by
diminishing<br>
the length of that part of the blade which is in contact with
the<br>
ice. This is done by putting curvature on the blade or making
it<br>
what is called "hog-backed." You see that everything is done
to<br>
diminish the area in contact with the ice, and thus to
increase<br>
the pressure. The result is a very great compression of the
ice<br>
beneath the edge of the skate. Even in the very coldest
weather<br>
melting must take place to some extent.</p>
<p>As we observed before, the melting is instantaneous,</p>
<p>275</p>
<p>Heat has not to travel from one point of the ice to
another;<br>
immediately the pressure comes on the ice it turns to water.
It<br>
takes the requisite heat from itself in order that the change
of<br>
state may be accomplished. So soon as the skate passes on,
the<br>
water resumes the solid state. It is probable that there is
an<br>
instantaneous escape, and re-freezing of some of the water
from<br>
beneath the skate, the skate instantly taking a fresh bearing
and<br>
melting more ice. The temperature of the water escaping from<br>
beneath the skate, or left behind by it, immediately becomes
what<br>
it was before the skate pressed upon it.</p>
<p>Thus, a most wonderful and complex series of molecular
events<br>
takes place beneath the skate. Swift as it passes, the whole<br>
sequence of events which James Thomson predicted has to take<br>
place beneath the blade Compression; lowering of the melting<br>
point below the temperature of the surrounding ice; melting;<br>
absorption of heat; and cooling to the new melting point,
_i.e._<br>
to that proper to the pressure beneath the blade. The skate
now<br>
passes on. Then follow: Relief of pressure; re-solidification
of<br>
the water; restoration of the borrowed heat from the
congealing<br>
water and reversion of the ice to the original temperature.</p>
<p>If we reflect for a moment on all this, we see that we do
not<br>
skate on ice but on water. We could not skate on ice any more<br>
than we could skate on glass. We saw that with light weights
and<br>
when the pressure</p>
<p>276</p>
<p>{Diagram}</p>
<p>Diagram showing successive states obtaining in ice,
before,<br>
during, and after the passage of the skate. The temperatures
and<br>
pressures selected for illustration are such as might occur
under<br>
ordinary conditions. The edge of the skate is shown in
magnified<br>
cross-section.</p>
<p>277</p>
<p>Was not sufficient to melt the ice, the friction was much
the<br>
same as that of metal on glass. Ice is not slippery. It is an<br>
error to say that it is. The learned professor was very much<br>
astray when he said that you could skate on ice because it is
so<br>
smooth. The smoothness of the ice has nothing to do with the<br>
matter. In short, owing to the action of gravity upon your
body,<br>
you escape the normal resistance of solid on solid, and glide<br>
about with feet winged like the messenger of the Gods; but on<br>
water.</p>
<p>A second condition essential to the art of skating is also<br>
involved in the melting of the ice. The sinking of the skate<br>
gives the skater "bite." This it is which enables him to urge<br>
himself forward. So long as skates consisted of the rounded
bones<br>
of animals, the skater had to use a pointed staff to propel<br>
himself. In creating bite, the skater again unconsciously
appeals<br>
to the peculiar physical properties of ice. The pressure
required<br>
for the propulsion of the skater is spread all along the
length<br>
of the groove he has cut in the ice, and obliquely downwards.
The<br>
skate will not slip away laterally, for the horizontal
component<br>
of the pressure is not enough to melt the ice. He thus gets
the<br>
resistance he requires.</p>
<p>You see what a very perfect contrivance the skate is; and what
a<br>
similitude of intelligence there is in its evolution. Blind<br>
intelligence, because it is certain the true physics of
skating<br>
was never held in view by</p>
<p>278</p>
<p>the makers of skates. The evolution of the skate has been
truly<br>
organic. The skater selected the fittest skate, and hence the
fit<br>
skate survived.</p>
<p>In a word, the possibility of skating depends on the
dynamical<br>
melting of ice under pressure. And observe the whole matter
turns<br>
upon the apparently unrelated fact that the freezing of water<br>
results in a solid more bulky than the water which gives rise
to<br>
it. If ice was less bulky than the water from which it was<br>
derived, pressure would not melt it; it would be all the more<br>
solid for the pressure, as it were. The melting point would
rise<br>
instead of falling. Most substances behave in this manner,
and<br>
hence we cannot skate upon them. Only quite a few substances<br>
expand on freezing, and it happens that their particular
melting<br>
temperatures or other properties render them unsuitable to<br>
skating. The most abundant fluid substance on the earth, and
the<br>
most abundant substance of any one kind on its surface, thus<br>
possesses the ideally correct and suitable properties for the
art<br>
of skating.</p>
<p>I have pointed out that the pressure must be such as to bring
the<br>
temperature of melting below that prevailing in the ice at
the<br>
time. We have seen also, that one atmosphere lowers the
melting<br>
point of ice by the 1/140 of a degree Centigrade; more exactly
by<br>
0.0075&deg;. Let us now assume that the skate is so far sunken in
the<br>
ice as to bear for a length of two inches, and for a width of<br>
one-hundredth of an inch. The skater weighs,</p>
<p>279</p>
<p>let us say&mdash;150 pounds. If this weight was borne on one
square<br>
inch, the pressure would be ten atmospheres. But the skater
rests<br>
his weight, in fact, upon an area of one-fiftieth of an inch.
The<br>
pressure is, therefore, fifty times as great. The ice is<br>
subjected to a pressure of 500 atmospheres. This lowers the<br>
melting point to -3.75&deg; C. Hence, on a day when the ice is
at<br>
this temperature, the skate will sink in the ice till the
weight<br>
of the skater is concentrated as we have assumed. His skate
can<br>
sink no further, for any lesser concentration of the pressure<br>
will not bring the melting point below the prevailing<br>
temperature. We can calculate the theoretical bite for any
state<br>
of the ice. If the ice is colder the bite will not be so deep.
If<br>
the temperature was twice as far below zero, then the area
over<br>
which the skater's weight will be distributed, when the skate
has<br>
penetrated its maximum depth, will be only half the former
area,<br>
and the pressure will be one thousand atmospheres.</p>
<p>An important consideration arises from the fact that under
the<br>
very extreme edge of the skate the pressure is indefinitely<br>
great. For this involves that there will always be some bite,<br>
however cold the ice may be. That is, the narrow strip of ice<br>
which first receives the skater's weight must partially
liquefy<br>
however cold the ice.</p>
<p>It must have happened to many here to be on ice which was
too<br>
cold to skate on with comfort. The</p>
<p>280</p>
<p>skater in this case speaks of the ice as too hard. In the<br>
Engadine, the ice on the large lakes gets so cold that
skaters<br>
complain of this. On the rinks, which are chiefly used there,
the<br>
ice is frequently renewed by flooding with water at the close
of<br>
the day. It thus never gets so very cold as on the lakes. I
have<br>
been on ice in North France, which, in the early morning, was
too<br>
hard to afford sufficient bite for comfort. The cause of this
is<br>
easily understood from what we have been considering.</p>
<p>We may now return to the experimental results which we
obtained<br>
early in the lecture. The heavy weights slip off the ice at a
low<br>
angle because just at the points of contact with the ice the<br>
latter melts, and they, in fact, slip not on ice but on
water.<br>
The light weights on cold, dry ice do not lower the melting
point<br>
below the temperature of the ice, _i.e._ below -10&deg; C., and
so<br>
they slip on dry ice. They therefore give us the true
coefficient<br>
of friction of metal on ice.</p>
<p>This subject has, more recently been investigated by H.
Morphy,<br>
of Trinity College, Dublin. The refinement of a closed vessel
at<br>
uniform temperature, in which the ice is formed and the<br>
experiment carried out, is introduced. Thermocouples give the<br>
temperatures, not only of the ice but of the aluminium sleigh<br>
which slips upon it under various loads. In this way we may
be<br>
certain that the metal runners are truly at the temperature
of<br>
the ice. I now quote from Morphy's paper</p>
<p>281</p>
<p>"The angle of friction was found to remain constant until
a<br>
certain stage of the loading, when it suddenly fell to about
half<br>
of its original value. It then remained constant for further<br>
increases in the load.</p>
<p>"These results, which confirmed those obtained previously
with<br>
less satisfactory apparatus, are shown in the table below. In
the<br>
first column is shown the load, _i.e._ the weight of sleigh +<br>
weight of shot added. In the second and third columns are
shown,<br>
respectively, the coefficient and angle of friction, whilst

<p>"These experiments were repeated on another occasion with the
same<br>
result and similar results had been obtained with different<br>
apparatus.</p>
<p>"As a result of the investigation the following points are<br>
clearly shown:&mdash;</p>
<p>282</p>
<p>"(1) The coefficient of friction for ice at constant
temperature<br>
may have either of two constant values according to the
pressure<br>
per unit surface of contact.</p>
<p>"(2) For small pressures, and up to a certain well defined
limit<br>
of pressure, the coefficient is fairly large, having the
value<br>
0.36&plusmn;.01 in the case investigated.</p>
<p>"(3) For pressures greater than the above limit the
coefficient<br>
is relatively small, having the value 0.17&plusmn;.01 in the
case<br>
investigated."</p>
<p>It will be seen that Morphy's results are similar to those<br>
arrived at in the first experimental consideration of our<br>
subject; but from the manner in which the experiments have
been<br>
carried out, they are more accurate and reliable.</p>
<p>A great deal more might be said about skating, and the
allied<br>
sports of tobogganing, sleighing, curling, ice yachting, and<br>
last, but by no means least, sliding&mdash;that unpretentious
pastime<br>
of the million. Happy the boy who has nails in his boots when<br>
Jack-Frost appears in his white garment, and congeals the<br>
neighbouring pond. But I must turn away at the threshold of
the<br>
humorous aspect of my subject (for the victim of the street<br>
"slide" owes his injured dignity to the abstruse laws we have<br>
been discussing) and pass to other and graver subjects
intimately<br>
connected with skating.</p>
<p>James Thomson pointed out that if we apply compressional
stress<br>
to an ice crystal contained in a vessel</p>
<p>283</p>
<p>which also contains other ice crystals, and water at 0&deg;
C., then<br>
the stressed crystal will melt and become water, but its<br>
counterpart or equivalent quantity of ice will reappear
elsewhere<br>
in the vessel. This is, obviously, but a deduction from the<br>
principles we have been examining. The phenomenon is commonly<br>
called "regelation." I have already made the usual regelation<br>
experiment before you when I compressed broken ice in this
mould.<br>
The result was a clear, hard and almost flawless lens of ice.
Now<br>
in this operation we must figure to ourselves the pieces of
ice<br>
when pressed against one another melting away where
compressed,<br>
and the water produced escaping into the spaces between the<br>
fragments, and there solidifying in virtue of its temperature<br>
being below the freezing point of unstressed water. The final<br>
result is the uniform lens of ice. The same process goes on in
a<br>
less perfect manner when you make&mdash;or shall I better
say&mdash;when you<br>
made snowballs.</p>
<p>We now come to theories of glacier motion; of which there
are<br>
two. The one refers it mainly to regelation; the other to a
real<br>
viscosity of the ice.</p>
<p>The late J. C. M'Connel established the fact that ice
possesses<br>
viscosity; that is, it will slowly yield and change its shape<br>
under long continued stresses. His observations, indeed, raise
a<br>
difficulty in applying this viscosity to explain glacier
motion,<br>
for he showed that an ice crystal is only viscous in a
certain<br>
structural</p>
<p>284</p>
<p>direction. A complex mixture of crystals such, as we know
glacier<br>
ice to be, ought, we would imagine, to display a nett or<br>
resultant rigidity. A mass of glacier ice when distorted by<br>
application of a force must, however, undergo precisely the<br>
transformations which took place in forming the lens from the<br>
fragments of ice. In fact, regelation will confer upon it all
the<br>
appearance of viscosity.</p>
<p>Let us picture to ourselves a glacier pressing its enormous
mass<br>
down a Swiss valley. At any point suppose it to be hindered
in<br>
its downward path by a rocky obstacle. At that point the ice<br>
turns to water just as it does beneath the skate. The cold
water<br>
escapes and solidifies elsewhere. But note this, only where
there<br>
is freedom from pressure. In escaping, it carries away its
latent<br>
heat of liquefaction, and this we must assume, is lost to the<br>
region of ice lately under pressure. This region will,
however,<br>
again warm up by conduction of heat from the surrounding ice,
or<br>
by the circulation of water from the suxface. Meanwhile, the<br>
pressure at that point has been relieved. The mechanical<br>
resistance is transferred elsewhere. At this new point there
is<br>
again melting and relief of pressure. In this manner the
glacier<br>
may be supposed to move down. There is continual flux of<br>
conducted heat and converted latent heat, hither and thither,
to<br>
and from the points of resistance. The final motion of the
whole<br>
mass is necessarily slow; a few feet in the day or, in
winter,</p>
<p>285</p>
<p>even only a few inches. And as we might expect, perfect
silence<br>
attends the downward slipping of the gigantic mass. The
motion<br>
is, I believe, sufficiently explained as a skating motion.
The<br>
skate is, however, fixed, the ice moves. The great Aletsch<br>
Glacier collects its snows among the highest summits of the<br>
Oberland. Thence, the consolidated ice makes its way into the<br>
Rhone Valley, travelling a distance of some 20 miles. The ice
now<br>
melting into the youthful Rhone fell upon the Monch, the
Jungfrau<br>
or the Eiger in the days when Elizabeth ruled in England and<br>
Shakespeare lived.</p>
<p>The ice-fall is a common sight on the glacier. In great lumps
and<br>
broken pinnacles it topples over some rocky obstacle and
falls<br>
shattered on to the glacier below. But a little further down
the<br>
wound is healed again, and regelation has restored the smooth<br>
surface of the glacier. All such phenomena are explained on
James<br>
Thomson's exposition of the behaviour of a substance which<br>
expands on passing from the liquid to the solid state.</p>
<p>We thus have arrived at very far-reaching considerations
arising<br>
out of skating and its science. The tendency for snow to<br>
accumulate on the highest regions of the Earth depends on<br>
principles which we cannot stop to consider. We know it
collects<br>
above a certain level even at the Equator. We may consider,
then,<br>
that but for the operation of the laws which James Thomson<br>
brought to light, and which his illustrious brother,</p>
<p>286</p>
<p>Lord Kelvin, made manifest, the uplands of the Earth could
not<br>
have freed themselves of the burthen of ice. The geological<br>
history of the Earth must have been profoundly modified. The<br>
higher levels must have been depressed; the general level of
the<br>
ocean relatively to the land thereby raised, and, it is even<br>
possible, that such a mean level might have been attained as<br>
would result in general submergence.</p>
<p>During the last great glacial period, we may say the fate of
the<br>
world hung on the operation of those laws which have concerned
us<br>
throughout this lecture. It is believed the ice was piled up to
a<br>
height of some 6,000 feet over the region of Scandinavia.
Under<br>
the influence of the pressure and fusion at points of
resistance,<br>
the accumulation was stayed, and it flowed southwards the<br>
accumulation was stayed, and it flowed southwards over
Northern<br>
Europe. The Highlands of Scotland were covered with, perhaps,<br>
three or four thousand feet of ice. Ireland was covered from<br>
north to south, and mighty ice-bergs floated from our western
and<br>
southern shores.</p>
<p>The transported or erratic stones, often of great size, which
are<br>
found in many parts of Ireland, are records of these long
past<br>
events: events which happened before Man, as a rational
being,<br>
appeared upon the Earth.</p>

<p>IN the material universe we find presented to our senses a<br>
physical development continually progressing, extending to
all,<br>
even the most minute, material configurations. Some
fundamental<br>
distinctions existing between this development as apparent in
the<br>
organic and the inorganic systems of the present day are
referred<br>
to elsewhere in this volume.[2] In the present essay, these<br>
systems as having a common origin and common ending, are
merged<br>
in the same consideration as to the nature of the origin of<br>
material systems in general. This present essay is occupied
by<br>
the consideration of the necessity of limiting material<br>
interactions in past time. The speculation originated in the<br>
difficulties which present themselves when we ascribe to
these<br>
interactions infinite duration in the past. These
difficulties<br>
first claim our consideration.</p>
<p>[1] Proc. Royal Dublin Soc., vol. vii., Part V, 1892.</p>
<p>[2] _The Abundance of Life._</p>
<p>288</p>
<p>Accepting the hypothesis of Kant and Laplace in its widest<br>
extension, we are referred to a primitive condition of wide<br>
material diffusion, and necessarily too of material
instability.<br>
The hypothesis is, in fact, based upon this material
instability.<br>
We may pursue the sequence of events assumed in this
hypothesis<br>
into the future, and into the past.</p>
<p>In the future we find finality to progress clearly indicated.
The<br>
hypothesis points to a time when there will be no more<br>
progressive change but a mere sequence of unfruitful events,
such<br>
as the eternal uniform motion of a mass of matter no longer<br>
gaining or losing heat in an ether possessed of a uniform<br>
distribution of energy in all its parts. Or, again, if the
ether<br>
absorb the energy of material motion, this vast and dark<br>
aggregation eternally poised and at rest within it. The action
is<br>
transferred to the subtle parts of the ether which suffer none
of<br>
the energy to degrade. This is, physically, a thinkable
future.<br>
Our minds suggest no change, and demand none. More than this,<br>
change is unthinkable according to our present ideas of
energy.<br>
Of progress there is an end.</p>
<p>This finality _&acirc; parte post_ is instructive.
Abstract<br>
considerations, based on geometrical or analytical
illustrations,<br>
question the finiteness of some physical developments. Thus
our<br>
sun may require eternal time to attain the temperature of the<br>
ether around it, the approach to this condition being assumed
to<br>
be asymptotic in</p>
<p>289</p>
<p>character. But consider the legitimate _reductio ad absurdum_
of<br>
an ember raked from a fire 1000 years ago. Is it not yet
cooled<br>
down to the constant temperature of its surroundings? And we
may<br>
evidently increase the time a million-fold if we please. It<br>
appears as if we must regard eternity as outliving every<br>
progressive change, For there is no convergence or
enfeeblement<br>
of time. The ever-flowing present moves no differently for
the<br>
occurrence of the mightiest or the most insignificant events.
And<br>
even if we say that time is only the attendant upon events,
yet<br>
this attendant waits patiently for the end, however long<br>
deferred.</p>
<p>Does the essentially material hypothesis of Kant and
Laplace<br>
account for an infinite past as thinkably as it accounts for
the<br>
infinite future? As this hypothesis is based upon material<br>
instability the question resolves itself into this:&mdash; Is
the<br>
assumption of an infinitely prolonged past instability a
probable<br>
or possible account of the past? There are, it appears to me,<br>
great difficulties involved in accepting the hypothesis of<br>
infinitely prolonged material instability. I will refer here
to<br>
three principal objections. The first may be called a<br>
metaphysical objection; the second is partly metaphysical and<br>
partly physical, the third may be considered a physical<br>
objection, as it is involved directly in the phenomena
presented<br>
by our universe.</p>
<p>The metaphysical objection must have presented itself to
every<br>
one who has considered the question. It may</p>
<p>290</p>
<p>be put thus:&mdash;If present events are merely one stage in
an<br>
infinite progress, why is not the present stage long ago
passed<br>
over? We are evidently at liberty to push back any stage of<br>
progress to as remote a period as we like by putting back
first<br>
the one before this and next the stage preceding this, and so
on,<br>
for, by hypothesis, there is no beginning to the progress.</p>
<p>Thus, the sum of passing events constituting the present
universe<br>
should long ago have been accomplished and passed away. If we<br>
consider alternative hypotheses not involving this difficulty,
we<br>
are at once struck by the fact that the future of material<br>
development is free of the objection. For the eternity of<br>
unprogressive events involved in the future on Kant's
hypothesis,<br>
is not only thinkable, but any change is, as observed,<br>
irreconcilable with our ideas of energy. As in the future so
in<br>
the past we look to a cessation to progress. But as we
believe<br>
the activity of the present universe must in some form have<br>
existed all along, the only refuge in the past is to imagine
an<br>
active but unprogressive eternity, the unprogressive activity
at<br>
some period becoming a progressive activity&mdash;that
progressive<br>
activity of which we are spectators. To the unprogressive<br>
activity there was no beginning; in fact, beginning is as<br>
unthinkable and uncalled for to the unprogressive activity of
the<br>
past as ending is to the unprogressive activity of the
future,<br>
when all developmental actions shall have ceased. There is no<br>
beginning or ending to the activity of the universe.</p>
<p>291</p>
<p>There is beginning and ending to present progressive
activity.<br>
Looking through the realm of nature we seek beginning and
ending,<br>
but "passing through nature to eternity" we find neither.
Both<br>
are justified; the questioning of the ancient poet regarding
the<br>
past, and of the modern regarding the future, quoted at the
head<br>
of this essay.</p>
<p>The next objection, which is in part metaphysical, is founded
on<br>
the difficulty of ascribing any ultimate reality or potency
to<br>
forces diminishing through eternal time. Thus, against the<br>
assumption that our universe is the result of material<br>
aggregation progressing over eternal time, which involves the<br>
primitive infinite separation of the particles, we may ask,
what<br>
force can have acted between particles sundered by infinite<br>
distance? The gravitational force falling off as the square
of<br>
the distance, must vanish at infinity if we mean what we say
when<br>
we ascribe infinite separation to them. Their condition is
then<br>
one of neutral stability, a finite movement of the particles<br>
neither increasing nor diminishing interaction. They had then<br>
remained eternally in their separated condition, there being
no<br>
cause to render such condition finite. The difficulty
involved<br>
here appears to me of the same nature as the difficulty of<br>
ascribing any residual heat to the sun after eternal time has<br>
elapsed. In both cases we are bound to prolong the time, from
our<br>
very idea of time, till progress is no more, when in the one
case<br>
we can imagine no mutual approximation of the</p>
<p>292</p>
<p>particles, in the other no further cooling of the body.
However,<br>
I will riot dwell further upon this objection, as it does not,
I<br>
believe, present itself with equal force to every mind. A
reason<br>
less open to dispute, as being less subjective, against the<br>
aggregation of infinitely remote particles as the origin of
our<br>
universe, is contained in the physical objection.</p>
<p>In this objection we consider that the appearance presented
by<br>
our universe negatives the hypothesis of infinitely prolonged<br>
aggregation. We base this negation upon the appearance of<br>
simultaneity ~ presented by the heavens, contending that this<br>
simultaneity is contrary to what we would expect to find in
the<br>
case of particles gathered from infinitely remote distances.<br>
Whether these particles were endowed with relative motions or
not<br>
is unimportant to the consideration. In what respects do the<br>
phenomena of our universe present the appearance of
simultaneous<br>
phenomena? We must remember that the suns in space are as
fires<br>
which brighten only for a moment and are then extinguished. It
is<br>
in this sense we must regard the longest burning of the
stars.<br>
Whether just lit or just expiring counts little in eternity.
The<br>
light and heat of the star is being absorbed by the ether of<br>
space as effectually and rapidly as the ocean swallows the
ripple<br>
from the wings of an expiring insect. Sir William Herschel
says<br>
of the galaxy of the milky way:&mdash; "We do not know the rate
of<br>
progress of this mysterious chronometer, but it is
nevertheless<br>
certain that it cannot</p>
<p>293</p>
<p>last for ever, and its past duration cannot be infinite." We
do<br>
not know, indeed, the rate of progress of the chronometer, but
if<br>
the dial be one divided into eternal durations the
consummation<br>
of any finite physical change represents such a movement of
the<br>
hand as is accomplished in a single vibration of the balance<br>
wheel.</p>
<p>Hence we must regard the hosts of glittering stars as a<br>
conflagration that has been simultaneously lighted up in the<br>
heavens. The enormous (to our ideas) thermal energy of the
stars<br>
resembles the scintillation of iron dust in a jar of oxygen
when<br>
a pinch of the dust is thrown in. Although some particles be<br>
burnt up before others become alight, and some linger yet a<br>
little longer than the others, in our day's work the<br>
scintillation of the iron dust is the work of a single
instant,<br>
and so in the long night of eternity the scintillation of the<br>
mightiest suns of space is over in a moment. A little longer,<br>
indeed, in duration than the life which stirs a moment in<br>
response to the diffusion of the energy, but only very little.
So<br>
must an Eternal Being regard the scintillation of the stars
and<br>
the periodic vibration of life in our geological time and the<br>
most enduring efforts of thought. The latter indeed are no
more<br>
lasting than</p>
<p>"... the labour of ants In the light of a million million
of<br>
suns."</p>
<p>But the myriad suns themselves, with their generations, are
the<br>
momentary gleam of lights for ever after extinguished.</p>
<p>294</p>
<p>Again, science suggests that the present process of
material<br>
aggregation is not finished, and possibly will only be when
it<br>
prevails universally. Hence the very distribution of the
stars,<br>
as we observe them, as isolated aggregations, indicates a<br>
development which in the infinite duration must be regarded
as<br>
equally advanced in all parts of stellar space and essentially
a<br>
simultaneous phenomenon. For were we spectators of a system
in<br>
which any very great difference of age prevailed, this very
great<br>
difference would be attended by some such appearance as the<br>
following:&mdash;</p>
<p>The aupearance of but one star, other generations being
long<br>
extinct or no others yet come into being; or, perhaps, a
faint<br>
nebulous wreath of aggregating matter somewhere solitary in
the<br>
heavens; or no sign of matter beyond our system, either
because<br>
ungathered or long passed away into darkness.[1]</p>
<p>Some such appearances were to be expected had the aggregation
of<br>
matter depended solely on chance encounters of particles<br>
scattered through infinite space.</p>
<p>For as, by hypothesis, the aggregation occupies an infinite
time<br>
in consummation it is nearly a certainty that each particle<br>
encountered after immeasurable time, and then for the first
time<br>
endowed with actual gravitational potential energy, would
have<br>
long expended this energy</p>
<p>[1] It is interesting to reflect upon the effect which an
entire<br>
absence of luminaries outside our solar system would have had<br>
upon the views of our philosophers and upon our outlook on
life.</p>
<p>295</p>
<p>before another particle was gathered. But the fact that so
many<br>
fires which we know to be of brief duration are scattered
through<br>
a region of space, and the fact of a configuration which we<br>
believe to be a transitory ore, suggest their simultaneous<br>
aggregation here and there. And in the nebulous wreaths
situated<br>
amidst the stars there is evidence that these actually
originated<br>
where they now are, for in such no relative motion, I
believe,<br>
has as yet been detected by the spectroscope. All this, too,
is<br>
in keeping with the nebular hypothesis of Kant and Laplace so<br>
long as this does not assume a primitive infinite dispersion
of<br>
matter, but the gathering of matter from finite distances
first<br>
into nebulous patches which aggregating with each other have<br>
given rise to our system of stars. But if we extend this<br>
hypothesis throughout an infinite past by the supposition of<br>
aggregation of infinitely remote particles we replace the<br>
simultaneous approach required in order to accotnt for the<br>
simultaneous phenomena visible in the heavens, by a succession
of<br>
aggregative events, by hypothesis at intervals of nearly
infinite<br>
duration, when the events of the universe had consisted of
fitful<br>
gleams lighted after eternities of time and extinguished for
yet<br>
other eternities.</p>
<p>Finally, if we seek to replace the eternal instability
involved<br>
in Kant's hypothesis when extended over an infinite past, by
any<br>
hypothesis of material stability, we at once find ourselves
in<br>
the difficulty that from the known properties of matter such<br>
stability must have been</p>
<p>296</p>
<p>permanent if ever existent, which is contrary to fact. Thus
the<br>
kinetic inertia expressed in Newton's first law of motion
might<br>
well be supposed to secure equilibrium with material
attraction,<br>
but if primevally diffused matter had ever thus been held in<br>
equilibrium it must have remained so, or it was maintained so<br>
imperfectly, which brings us back to endless evolution.</p>
<p>On these grounds I contend that the present gravitational<br>
properties of matter cannot be supposed to have acted for all<br>
past duration. Universal equilibrium of gravitating particles<br>
would have been indestructible by internal causes. Perpetual<br>
instability or evolution is alike unthinkable and contrary to
the<br>
phenomena of the universe of which we are cognisant. We
therefore<br>
turn from gravitating matter as affording no rational account
of<br>
the past. We do so of necessity, however much we feel our<br>
ignorance of the nature of the unknown actions to which we
have<br>
recourse.</p>
<p>A prematerial condition of the universe was, we assume, a<br>
condition in which uniformity as regards the average
distribution<br>
of energy in space prevailed, but neterogeneity and
instability<br>
were possible. The realization of that possibility was the<br>
beginning we seek, and we today are witnesses of the train of<br>
events involved in the breakdown of an eternal past
equilibrium.<br>
We are witnesses on this hypothesis, of a catastrophe
possibly<br>
confined to certain regions of space, but which is, to the<br>
motions and configurations concerned, absolutely unique,<br>
reversible to</p>
<p>297</p>
<p>its former condition of potential by no process of which we
can<br>
have any conception.</p>
<p>Our speculation is that we, as spectators of evolution,
are<br>
witnessing the interaction of forces which have not always
been<br>
acting. A prematerial state of the universe was one of
unfruitful<br>
motions, that is, motions unattended by progressing changes,
in<br>
our region of the ether. How extended we cannot say; the
nature<br>
of the motions we know not; but the kinetic entities differed<br>
from matter in the one important particular of not possessing<br>
gravitational attraction. Such kinetic configurations we
cannot<br>
consider to be matter. It was _possible_ to construct matter
by<br>
their summation or linkage as the configuration of the crystal
is<br>
possible in the clear supersaturated liquid.</p>
<p>Duration in an ether filled with such motions would pass in
a<br>
succession of mere unfruitful events; as duration, we may<br>
imagine, even now passes in parts of the ether similar to our<br>
own. An endless (it may be) succession of unprogressive,<br>
fruitless events. But at one moment in the infinite duration
the<br>
requisite configuration of the elementary motions is
attained;<br>
solely by the one chance disposition the stability of all
must<br>
go, spreading from the fateful point.</p>
<p>Possibly the material segregation was confined to one part
of<br>
space, the elementary motions condensing upon transformation,
and<br>
so impoverishing the ether around till the action ceased.
Again<br>
in the same sense as the</p>
<p>298</p>
<p>stars are simultaneous, so also they may be regarded as
uniform<br>
in size, for the difference in magnitude might have been
anything<br>
we please to imagine, if at the same time we ascribe
sufficient<br>
distance sundering great and small. So, too;, will a dilute<br>
solution of acetate of soda build a crystal at one point, and
the<br>
impoverishment of the medium checking the growth in this
region,<br>
another centre will begin at the furthest extremities of the<br>
first crystal till the liquid is filled with loose feathery<br>
aggregations comparable in size with one another. In a
similar<br>
way the crystallizing out of matter may have given rise, not to
a<br>
uniform nebula in space, but to detached nebula, approximately
of<br>
equal mass, from which ultimately were formed the stars.</p>
<p>That an all-knowing Being might have foretold the ultimate
event<br>
at any preceding period by observing the motions of the parts<br>
then occurring, and reasoning as to the train of consequences<br>
arising from these nations, is supposable. But considerations<br>
arising from this involve no difficulty in ascribing to this<br>
prematerial train of events infinite duration. For progress
there<br>
is none, and we can quite as easily conceive of some part of<br>
space where the same Infinite Intelligence, contemplating a<br>
similar train of unfruitful motions, finds that at no time in
the<br>
future will the equilibrium be disturbed. But where evolution
is<br>
progressing this is no longer conceivable, as being
contradictory<br>
to the very idea of progressive development. In this case<br>
Infinite Intelligence</p>
<p>299</p>
<p>_necessarily_ finds, as the result of his contemplation,
the<br>
aggregation of matter, and the consequences arising
therefrom.</p>
<p>The negation of so primary a material property as gravitation
to<br>
these primitive motions of (or in) the ether, probably
involves<br>
the negation of many properties we find associated with
matter.<br>
Possibly the quality of inertia, equally primary, is involved<br>
with that of gravitation, and we may suppose that these two<br>
properties so intimately associated in determining the motions
of<br>
bodies in space were conferred upon the primitive motions as<br>
crystallographic attraction and rigidity are first conferred
upon<br>
the solid growing from the supersaturated liquid. But in some<br>
degree less speculative is the supposition that the new order
of<br>
motions involved the transformation of much energy into the
form<br>
of heat vibrations; so that the newly generated matter, like
the<br>
newly formed crystal, began its existence in a medium richly
fed<br>
with thermal radiant energy. We may consider that the thermal<br>
conditions were such as would account for a primitive<br>
dissociation of the elements. And, again, we recall how the<br>
physicist finds his estimate of the energy involved in mere<br>
gravitational aggregation inadequate to afford explanation of<br>
past solar heat. It is supposable, on such a hypothesis as we<br>
have been dwelling on, that the entire subsequent
gravitational<br>
condensation and conversion of material potential energy,
dating<br>
from the first formation of matter to the stage of star<br>
formation</p>
<p>300</p>
<p>may be insignificant in amount compared with the conversion
of<br>
etherial energy attending the crystallizing out of matter
from<br>
the primitive motions. And thus possibly the conditions then<br>
obtaining involved a progressively increasing complexity of<br>
material structure the genesis of the elements, from an<br>
infra-hydrogen possessing the simplest material
configuration,<br>
resulting ultimately in such self-luminous nebula as we yet
see<br>
in the heavens.</p>
<p>The late James Croll, in his _Stellar Evolution_, finds
objections<br>
to an eternal evolution, one of which is similar to the<br>
"metaphysical" objection urged in this paper. His way out of
the<br>
difficulty is in the speculation that our stellar system<br>
originated by the collision of two masses endowed with
relative<br>
motion, eternal in past duration, their meeting ushering in
the<br>
dawn of evolution. However, the state of aggregation here<br>
assumed, from the known laws of matter and from analogy,
calls<br>
for explanation as probably the result of prior diffusion,
when,<br>
of course, the difficulty is only put back, not set at rest.
Nor<br>
do I think the primitive collision in harmony with the number
of<br>
relatively stationary nebula visible in space.</p>
<p>The metaphysical objection is, I find, also urged by
George<br>
Salmon, late Provost of Trinity College, in favour of the<br>
creation of the universe.&mdash;(_Sermons on Agnosticism_.)</p>
<p>A. Winchell, in _World Life_, says: "We have not</p>
<p>301</p>
<p>the slightest scientific grounds for assuming that matter
existed<br>
in a certain condition from all eternity. The essential
activity<br>
of the powers ascribed to it forbids the thought; for all that
we<br>
know, and, indeed, as the _conclusion_ from all that we know,<br>
primal matter began its progressive changes on the morning of
its<br>
existence."</p>
<p>Finally, in reference to the hypothesis of a unique
determination<br>
of matter after eternal duration in the past, it may not be
out<br>
of place to remind the reader of the complexity which modern<br>
research ascribes to the structure of the atom.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
